# Markdown Generation Instructions for LLM

## General Structure
- Follow the **Book Structure Guide** to determine the correct header level based on the filename.
- Maintain logical progression and coherence across sections.

## Math Formatting
- Always use `$$` for LaTeX math, even inline.
- Prefer full display math format:

  ```
  $$
  (insert LaTeX here)
  $$
  ```
- Even for inline math, use double dollar signs:

  ```
  $$x$$ is a variable.
  ```

## Formatting and Engagement
- **No extra horizontal rules** (`---`).
- Use **blockquotes** to highlight key insights or quotes.
- Use **lists, bold, italics**, and **examples** to enhance readability.
- Ensure the tone is engaging, structured, and aligned with educational best practices.

## Output Consistency
- Ensure uniform formatting across all sections.
- Content should be well-structured for seamless conversion through Pandoc into LaTeX.

Follow these guidelines strictly to maintain high-quality, structured, and engaging content.
