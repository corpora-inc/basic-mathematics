# Basic Mathematics

Welcome to the Basic Mathematics curriculum repository, a comprehensive resource for K-12 mathematics education. Our goal is to provide an organized and engaging learning experience for students, teachers, and parents across pre-secondary grades in the US.

## Repository Structure

The curriculum is divided into separate textbooks for each grade level, with lessons and sections organized into individual files. This structure allows for easy navigation and use.

- `000_kindergarten/`
- `001_grade_1/`
- `002_grade_2/`
- ...
- `012_grade_12/`

Within each grade directory, materials are broken down into lessons and sections using clear and descriptive filenames:

```
001_grade_1/
│
├── 001_lesson_addition.md
├── 002_lesson_subtraction.md
├── 003_lesson_basic-geometry.md
└── ...
```

Contributions from educators and developers are welcome. Please check contribution guidelines in the respective directories.
