# Geometry

Geometry is the area of mathematics that deals with shapes, sizes, and the properties of space. In Grade 3, students will explore the basic concepts of geometry, focusing on both two-dimensional and three-dimensional shapes.

> **Key Concepts**
>
> - **Shapes and Properties**: Understanding different types of shapes, their properties, and how they relate to one another.
> - **Perimeter and Area**: Learning how to measure the perimeter of polygons and calculate the area of simple shapes.
> - **Lines and Angles**: Introduction to different types of lines and angles, fostering spatial awareness.

**Applications of Geometry**

- **Architecture**: Geometry is foundational in designing buildings and structures, where understanding shapes and spaces is crucial.

- **Art and Design**: Artists and designers use geometric principles to structure and create visual art pieces.

- **Engineering**: In engineering, geometry helps in the design of everything from circuits to bridges, ensuring efficient and functional designs.

By the end of this section, students will have a solid grasp of geometry's fundamental principles, enhancing their spatial reasoning and problem-solving skills.
