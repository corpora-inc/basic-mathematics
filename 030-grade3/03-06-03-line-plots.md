### Line Plots

A line plot is a simple way to display data along a number line. It is useful for showing the frequency of data points and is often used when dealing with smaller sets of data. Understanding how to create and interpret line plots will enhance your data handling skills.

#### What is a Line Plot?

A line plot displays data along a number line where each data point is represented as a mark (usually an "X") above its value on the line. This type of graph helps to visualize the distribution of data and identify any patterns or trends.

For example, if you have data on the number of books read by students in a week and the data points are as follows: 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 2, the line plot would represent these numbers with the frequency of each number marked along the line.

The line plot for these data would look like this:

```
  x  
  x  
  x  x
  x  x
-------
2  3  4  5
```

#### How to Create a Line Plot

1. **Draw a Horizontal Line**: Start by drawing a horizontal line. This will serve as your number line.
2. **Label the Line**: Mark the numbers or categories you need to display along this line.
3. **Plot the Data Points**: For each data point, put an "X" above the corresponding value on the number line.
4. **Count the Frequency**: Ensure each data point is represented by an equal number of marks above the line representing its frequency.

#### Interpreting Line Plots

Line plots can tell us several things about the data:
- **Mode**: The number that appears the most. In our example, $5$ is the mode because it occurs most frequently.
- **Trends**: They help us see if there's an increase or decrease in the frequency of certain data points.
- **Gaps and Clusters**: Identify gaps (where little or no data exists) and clusters (where many data points are grouped).

#### Real-World Applications

Line plots are used in various settings: 
- **Education**: To track student performance over time.
- **Medicine**: To record patient data such as daily temperatures.
- **Business**: For inventory tracking or sales data analysis.

#### Practice Problems

1. Create a line plot using the following data of heights (in feet) of a group of plants: 1.2, 1.5, 1.5, 1.7, 1.3, 1.5, 1.7.

2. Given a line plot with marks clustered around certain numbers, identify the mode of the dataset.

3. Interpret the following line plot and describe what the data might represent.

   ```
     x
     x  x  
     x  x
     x  x
   ---------
   1  2  3  4  5
   ```

By practicing these skills, you will improve your ability to understand and analyze data effectively using line plots.
