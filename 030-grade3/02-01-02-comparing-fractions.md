### Comparing Fractions

Understanding how to compare fractions is a fundamental skill in mathematics. Fractions represent parts of a whole, and knowing which fraction is larger or smaller is essential in daily activities, such as cooking and budgeting. This lesson aims to teach you how to accurately compare fractions using various methods.

#### Visual Representation on a Number Line

A number line can be a powerful tool to compare fractions. By plotting fractions on a number line, you can easily see which fraction is greater by observing their positions:

- **Example**: Compare $\frac{1}{4}$ and $\frac{3}{8}$.

  - Convert each fraction so they have the same denominator. Find a common denominator:
    $$
    \text{LCM of 4 and 8 is 8} \\
    \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{8}\
    $$
  - Now $\frac{2}{8}$ and $\frac{3}{8}$ can be compared directly. Since 2 < 3, $\frac{1}{4} < \frac{3}{8}$.

#### Using Equivalent Fractions

Finding equivalent fractions with a common denominator allows direct comparison:

- **Example**: Compare $\frac{5}{6}$ and $\frac{7}{9}$.

  - Find the least common denominator (LCD):
    $$
    \text{LCM of 6 and 9 is 18} \\
    \frac{5}{6} = \frac{15}{18}, \quad \frac{7}{9} = \frac{14}{18}
    $$
  - Since \(15 > 14\), $\frac{5}{6} > \frac{7}{9}$.

#### Cross-Multiplication Method

Cross-multiplication is an efficient way to compare two fractions:

- **Example**: Compare $\frac{3}{5}$ and $\frac{4}{7}$.

  - Cross multiply:
    $$
    3 \times 7 = 21, \quad 4 \times 5 = 20
    $$
  - Since 21 > 20, $\frac{3}{5} > \frac{4}{7}$.

#### Real-World Application

Being able to compare fractions is vital in many real-life scenarios:

- **Cooking**: Adjusting recipes based on portion sizes.
- **Budgeting**: Comparing costs and savings proportions.

Understanding these concepts enhances your ability to make informed decisions when dealing with fractional parts in everyday situations.

#### Practice Problems

1. Compare the following fractions: $\frac{2}{3}$ and $\frac{3}{5}$.
2. Which is larger: $\frac{5}{8}$ or $\frac{2}{3}$?
3. Order these fractions from smallest to largest: $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{5}{6}, \frac{3}{4}$.
4. Determine which fraction is smaller: $\frac{7}{10}$ or $\frac{2}{3}$.
5. Arrange these fractions in descending order: $\frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{7}, \frac{5}{9}$.
