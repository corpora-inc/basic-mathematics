### Likely vs. Unlikely

Probability is a branch of mathematics that deals with the likelihood or chance of different outcomes. Understanding probability helps us make predictions and informed decisions based on events and their likelihood.

#### Definitions

- **Likely**: An event is likely if it has a high chance of happening. This means that, based on what we know, it is expected to occur more often than not.
- **Unlikely**: An event is unlikely if it has a low chance of happening. This means that it is not expected to occur often or it might not happen at all.

#### Examples

- **Likely Event**: If you flip a coin, getting heads or tails is likely because there are only two possible outcomes, and each is equally likely.
- **Unlikely Event**: Rolling a standard six-sided die and getting a number 7 is unlikely because a standard die only has numbers 1 through 6.

#### Real-World Applications

Understanding what is likely and unlikely can help us in our daily activities. For instance:

- **Weather Forecasting**: When meteorologists say there is an 80% chance of rain, rain is a likely event. This helps people decide whether to carry an umbrella.
- **Sports**: Analyzing the likelihood of a team winning based on their past performance.

#### Practice Problems

1. Think of a typical day at school. List two events that are likely and two events that are unlikely to happen during a school day.
2. You have a bag of 5 red marbles, 3 blue marbles, and 2 green marbles. If you draw one marble without looking, is it likely or unlikely that you will pick a red marble? Explain why.
3. Consider a deck of cards. What is the likelihood of drawing a king or queen compared to drawing a card of hearts? Which one is more likely and why?
