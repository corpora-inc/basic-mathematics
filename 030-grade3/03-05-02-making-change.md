### Making Change

Being able to make change is an essential skill when dealing with money transactions. Understanding how to make change helps in everyday situations such as shopping, budgeting, and managing finances.

#### Basic Steps in Making Change
1. **Identify the Total Cost:** Begin by knowing the total amount that needs to be paid.
2. **Determine the Amount Given:** Note the amount of money provided by the customer.
3. **Calculate the Change Needed:** Subtract the total cost from the amount given to find out how much change is required.
4. **Select the Coins and Bills for Change:** Break down the change into a combination of coins and bills to give back.

For example, if a toy costs $3.75 and the customer gives $5.00, the change needed is calculated as follows:

$$
5.00 - 3.75 = 1.25
$$

In this case, the change would be $1.25, which can be given as one $1 bill and one quarter.

#### Real-World Applications
- **Shopping:** Ensures you receive the correct change after making a purchase.
- **Budgeting:** Helps in planning how to break larger bills into smaller denominations for specific expenses.
- **Financial Literacy:** Builds a foundational understanding of currency and transactions.

#### Practice Problems
1. Maria buys a sandwich for $4.50 and pays with a $10 bill. How much change should she receive?
2. A book costs $7.25, and Tyler pays with a $20 bill. What is the correct amount of change he should get back?
3. Adam bought a toy car for $8.99 and paid with a $10 bill. Calculate the change he should receive.
4. Sheila purchases a notebook for $2.15 and uses a $5 bill. Determine the change she is owed.
5. If a meal costs $12.80 and is paid with a $20 bill, how much change should be provided back?

These practice problems involve simple arithmetic operations and encourage the application of making change in various scenarios.
