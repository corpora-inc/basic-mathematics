## Division

Division is one of the four fundamental operations in mathematics, and it involves splitting a number into equal parts. It is essentially the process of determining how many times one number is contained within another. In simpler terms, division answers the question, "How many groups of a certain size can be made from a total number?"

### Key Concepts of Division

- **Dividend**: The number that is being divided.
- **Divisor**: The number by which the dividend is divided.
- **Quotient**: The result of the division.
- **Remainder**: The leftover part when the division is not exact.

For example, in the division equation $12 \div 3 = 4$, 12 is the dividend, 3 is the divisor, and 4 is the quotient.

### Division in Everyday Life

Division is a critical operation used in many real-life situations. For example, if you have 24 candies and want to distribute them equally among 4 friends, division helps to determine that each friend receives 6 candies. Similarly, division is employed in tasks such as dividing resources, calculating averages, and converting units.

### Practice Problems

1. Divide 18 by 3 and find the quotient.
2. If you divide 25 apples among 5 baskets, how many apples will each basket hold?
3. Consider there are 48 books, and you want to arrange them equally in 6 shelves. How many books will each shelf contain?
4. Find the quotient when 36 is divided by 6.
5. Share 55 marbles equally among 11 bags. How many marbles does each bag hold?
