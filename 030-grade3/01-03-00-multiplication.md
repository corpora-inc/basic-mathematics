## Multiplication

Multiplication is one of the basic operations in mathematics. It is a way of adding a number to itself a certain number of times. When you multiply, you are combining equal groups to find out how many objects you have in total.

### Understanding Multiplication

Imagine you have a collection of toy cars. If you have 3 groups of 2 toy cars, how many toy cars do you have altogether? Instead of adding 2 + 2 + 2, you can multiply:

$$
3 \times 2 = 6
$$

This means you have 3 groups of 2 cars, which equals 6 cars in total.

### Practical Tips

A helpful way to understand multiplication is by using graph paper. You can draw rows and columns to represent groups and the number of objects in each group.

- **Example:** To find out how many plates are needed if each table has 4 plates and there are 5 tables, draw 5 rows with 4 squares in each row on graph paper. Count all the squares to find the total.

This visual approach helps you see the multiplication result clearly as a rectangular array.

### Real-world Example

Multiplication is used in many everyday situations. Suppose youâ€™re planning seating for 5 tables at a party, and each table needs 4 plates:

- Draw 5 rows of 4 blocks on graph paper.
- Count the blocks: there are $$5 \times 4 = 20$$ squares.

This shows you need 20 plates in total.

### Practice Problems

1. How many stars are there if you have 4 groups of 5 stars?
2. If there are 6 baskets with 3 apples in each, how many apples are there in total?
3. There are 2 cars, each with 4 wheels. How many wheels are there altogether?
4. If you buy 7 packs of stickers, and each pack has 6 stickers, how many stickers do you have?
5. Imagine you have 8 shelves, and each shelf has 9 books. How many books are there on the shelves combined?
