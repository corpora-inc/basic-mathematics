### Length Conversion

#### Understanding Length Conversion

Length conversion is the process of changing a measurement from one unit to another. This skill is important in various fields, such as science, engineering, and everyday living, where precise measurements are often necessary. In this lesson, we will focus on converting between different units of length, particularly in the metric and customary systems.

#### Units of Length

1. **Customary System**: This is used primarily in the United States.
   - **Inches (in)**
   - **Feet (ft)**: 1 foot = 12 inches
   - **Yards (yd)**: 1 yard = 3 feet = 36 inches

2. **Metric System**: This is used widely around the world.
   - **Millimeters (mm)**
   - **Centimeters (cm)**: 1 centimeter = 10 millimeters
   - **Meters (m)**: 1 meter = 100 centimeters = 1,000 millimeters

#### Converting Between Units

To convert between different units of length, you can use multiplication or division based on their relationships. Here are some examples:

- **From Inches to Feet**: Divide the number of inches by 12, because there are 12 inches in a foot.

  Example:
  - Convert 36 inches to feet.
  - $$36 \div 12 = 3$$ feet

- **From Centimeters to Meters**: Divide the number of centimeters by 100, as there are 100 centimeters in a meter.

  Example:
  - Convert 250 centimeters to meters.
  - $$250 \div 100 = 2.5$$ meters

#### Real-World Applications

Length conversion is widely applicable. For example, if you are building something using plans that are measured in feet, but your tools use metric measurements, you will need to convert these measurements accurately. Scientists also frequently convert units to ensure data consistency in experiments conducted in different parts of the world.

#### Practice Problems

1. Convert 72 inches to feet.
2. Convert 1,500 millimeters to meters.
3. Convert 9 feet to inches.
4. Convert 2.75 meters to centimeters.
5. Convert 45 centimeters to millimeters.
