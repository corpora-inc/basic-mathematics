## Perimeter and Area

Perimeter and area are fundamental concepts in geometry that help us understand the size and shape of two-dimensional figures. In this section, we will introduce these concepts and explore their practical applications. Understanding perimeter and area is essential for solving problems in everyday contexts, such as building a fence around a garden or laying tiles on a floor.

**Key Concepts**

- **Perimeter**: The perimeter is the distance around the outside of a shape. It is measured by adding together the lengths of all the sides of the shape.
  - **Practical Example**: To find out how much fence is needed to enclose a rectangular garden, calculate the perimeter by adding the lengths of all four sides.

- **Area**: The area is the space covered by a shape's surface. It is measured in square units, which represents the number of unit squares that fit inside the shape.
  - **Practical Example**: To determine how many tiles are required to cover a square kitchen floor, calculate the area by multiplying the length by the width if it's rectangular.

These concepts are particularly useful in fields such as architecture, land management, and interior design, where measuring and space allocation are crucial.
