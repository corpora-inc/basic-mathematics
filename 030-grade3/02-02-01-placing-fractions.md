### Placing Fractions on a Number Line

Placing fractions on a number line helps to visualize the size of fractions and how they relate to whole numbers. A number line is a straight line with numbers placed at equal intervals or segments. It is a useful tool for understanding the value of fractions and comparing them with each other.

#### Understanding the Number Line

A number line can represent whole numbers, fractions, or decimals. To place a fraction on a number line, you need to determine the segment where the fraction fits between two whole numbers.

**Example:** Place the fraction $\frac{1}{4}$ on a number line between 0 and 1.

1. Divide the segment between 0 and 1 into 4 equal parts, each representing $\frac{1}{4}$.
2. Count from 0, marking each division until you reach $\frac{1}{4}$.

The fraction $\frac{1}{4}$ is located after the first division away from 0.

#### Placing Fractions Greater Than 1

Fractions greater than 1 (also called improper fractions) can also be placed on a number line. These fractions have numerators larger than denominators.

**Example:** Place the fraction $\frac{5}{4}$ on a number line.

1. Recognize that $\frac{5}{4} = 1 \frac{1}{4}$, which means 1 whole and $\frac{1}{4}$.
2. Locate 1 on the number line and then add another $\frac{1}{4}$ past 1.

The fraction $\frac{5}{4}$ is positioned one place beyond 1.

#### Real-World Application

Understanding fractions on a number line is crucial in everyday tasks such as cooking or measuring materials. For instance, if a recipe requires $\frac{3}{4}$ of a cup of sugar, knowing how this fraction relates to a full cup on a measuring line helps accurately prepare meals.

#### Practice Problems

1. Place the fraction $\frac{2}{3}$ on a number line between 0 and 1.
2. Compare $\frac{3}{8}$ and $\frac{5}{8}$ on a number line. Which is greater?
3. Place the improper fraction $\frac{9}{4}$ on a number line, and express it as a mixed number.
4. If you have a number line marked from 0 to 2, where would $\frac{7}{4}$ be located?
5. On a number line, if the point at $\frac{1}{2}$ is labeled, how many equal segments must the interval from 0 to 1 be divided into to accurately place the fraction?
6. Locate $\frac{3}{2}$ on a number line between 0 and 2.
7. Place $\frac{7}{5}$ on a number line between 0 and 2.
8. Draw a number line from 0 to 3 and mark $\frac{5}{3}$ on it.
9. Locate $\frac{11}{6}$ on a number line between 0 and 2.
10. Place $\frac{13}{8}$ on a number line between 0 and 2.
