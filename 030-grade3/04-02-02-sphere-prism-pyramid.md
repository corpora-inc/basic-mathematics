### Sphere, Prism, and Pyramid

In this lesson, we will explore three different solid shapes: sphere, prism, and pyramid. Understanding these shapes is essential as they form the basis for many objects we encounter daily and are foundational in various fields such as architecture and design.

#### Sphere

A **sphere** is a perfectly round 3-dimensional shape, like a ball. Every point on the surface of a sphere is the same distance from its center.

- **Examples in real life**: basketball, globe, and marbles.
- **Key features**: It has no edges or vertices and only one curved surface.

#### Prism

A **prism** is a polyhedron with two parallel, congruent bases connected by rectangular faces. The type of prism is determined by the shape of its base.

- **Examples in real life**: a rectangular cardboard box (rectangular prism), a tent with a triangular base (triangular prism), or a hexagonal pencil (hexagonal prism).
- **Key features**: Has uniform cross-sections along its length, edges, vertices, and faces.

#### Pyramid

A **pyramid** is a polyhedron that has a base and triangular faces that meet at a point called the apex. The shape of the base determines the type of the pyramid.

- **Examples in real life**: Egyptian pyramids (square base), a pyramid-shaped award, or a tetrahedron die (triangular pyramid).
- **Key features**: Has a set of triangular faces converging at a single point (apex), edges, vertices, and a base.

#### Real-World Applications

- **Architecture**: Pyramids are used in buildings like the Louvre Pyramid in Paris.
- **Design**: Spheres and prisms are commonly found in various design aspects, enhancing aesthetics and functionality.

#### Practice Problems

1. Identify three objects in your home that resemble a sphere, a prism, and a pyramid. Describe each and explain why they match their respective shapes.

2. Sketch a triangular prism, labeling its faces, edges, and vertices.

3. Calculate the number of edges, vertices, and faces a square pyramid has. Explain your reasoning.

4. Compare a sphere and a prism: What are the main differences in their shapes and properties? Discuss how these differences affect their uses in real life. 

5. Design a simple model using one sphere, one prism, and one pyramid. Describe how they could fit together and the purpose of your model.
