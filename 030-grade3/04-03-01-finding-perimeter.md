### Finding Perimeter

The perimeter of a shape is the total distance around the shape's edges. It is a crucial concept in geometry, especially when dealing with two-dimensional figures such as polygons. Learning to calculate the perimeter helps in various practical situations, such as determining the amount of material needed to fence a garden or frame a picture.

#### Understanding Perimeter

To find the perimeter of a shape, you add together the lengths of all its sides. Different shapes have different formulas depending on the number and length of their sides.

- **Rectangle**: The perimeter $P$ is calculated as $P = 2(l + w)$ where $l$ is the length and $w$ is the width.
- **Square**: Since all four sides are equal, the perimeter $P$ is $P = 4s$ where $s$ is the length of a side.
- **Triangle**: The perimeter $P$ is the sum of all its sides, $P = a + b + c$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the lengths of the sides.

#### Examples

1. **Rectangle**: A rectangle with a length of 5 cm and a width of 3 cm has a perimeter:
   $$
   P = 2(5 + 3) = 2 	imes 8 = 16 	ext{ cm}
   $$

2. **Square**: A square with each side measuring 4 m has a perimeter:
   $$
   P = 4 	imes 4 = 16 	ext{ m}
   $$

3. **Triangle**: A triangle with sides measuring 6 cm, 8 cm, and 10 cm has a perimeter:
   $$
   P = 6 + 8 + 10 = 24 	ext{ cm}
   $$

#### Practice Problems

1. Find the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 7 meters and a width of 4 meters.
2. A square has a perimeter of 20 inches. What is the length of one side?
3. Determine the perimeter of a triangle with sides measuring 5 cm, 12 cm, and 13 cm.
4. A garden is shaped like a rectangle with dimensions 9 meters by 3 meters. If you want to install a fence around the garden, how much fencing material is required?
5. If the length of a rectangle is twice its width and its perimeter is 36 cm, find the dimensions of the rectangle.
