### Missing Addends

In mathematics, an *addend* is a number that is added to another in an addition operation. Understanding missing addends involves finding the unknown number in an addition equation that makes the equation true. This is a fundamental skill that helps strengthen algebraic thinking and problem-solving abilities.

#### Understanding the Concept

Consider the equation: 

$$
5 + x = 12
$$

Here, the number $5$ is an addend, and we need to find the other addend, represented by $x$, such that their sum is $12$.

To find the missing addend, we can rearrange the equation by subtracting the known addend from the total: 

$$
x = 12 - 5
$$

Thus, $x = 7$. The missing addend is $7$ because $5 + 7 = 12$.

#### Real-World Application

Understanding missing addends can be particularly useful in everyday situations, such as when you need to determine how much more money you need to save to buy a toy, or how many more points you need to win a game.

For instance, if you have saved $8$ dollars and the toy costs $15$ dollars, you can find out how much more you need by solving the equation:

$$
8 + x = 15
$$

Here, $x$ represents the additional amount needed.

After solving, $x = 15 - 8 = 7$. You need to save an additional $7$ dollars.

#### Solving Missing Addends

1. **Identify the known addend and the total.**
2. **Subtract the known addend from the total to find the unknown addend.**
3. **Verify by adding the found addend back to the known addend to ensure it equals the total.**

#### Practice Problems

1. Solve for the missing addend: 
    - $10 + x = 25$
    - $x + 15 = 23$
    - $7 + x = 20$

2. In a game, a player must score a total of 50 points to win. They have already scored 32 points. How many more points do they need?

3. Maria has baked 18 cookies. If she wants to have 30 cookies total, how many more does she need to bake?

4. A bookshelf has 5 books on it, but can hold 12 books. How many more books can the shelf hold?

These exercises help in deepening the understanding of how to work with missing addends, gradually building up to more complex algebraic problems.
