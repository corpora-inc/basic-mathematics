### Division Facts 0-5

Division is the process of splitting a number into equal parts. Understanding basic division facts is crucial for solving more complex mathematical problems. This lesson focuses on division facts where the divisor is between 0 and 5.

#### Importance of Division Facts

Mastering division facts helps in:

- **Problem Solving**: Quick recall of these facts aids in tackling mathematical problems efficiently.
- **Algebraic Understanding**: Sets a foundation for understanding algebraic expressions that involve division.
- **Daily Life Applications**: Useful in sharing, distributing resources, and budgeting.

#### Division with Zero

Dividing any number by zero is undefined because division by zero does not result in a meaningful number. Thus, for all numbers $a$, $a ÷ 0$ is undefined.

#### Division by One

Any number divided by one results in the number itself. For example, for any number $a$, $a ÷ 1 = a$.

#### Division Facts for 2

Understanding division as the opposite of multiplication helps with learning facts:

- $2 ÷ 2 = 1$
- $4 ÷ 2 = 2$
- $6 ÷ 2 = 3$
- $8 ÷ 2 = 4$
- $10 ÷ 2 = 5$

#### Division Facts for 3

- $3 ÷ 3 = 1$
- $6 ÷ 3 = 2$
- $9 ÷ 3 = 3$
- $12 ÷ 3 = 4$
- $15 ÷ 3 = 5$

#### Division Facts for 4

- $4 ÷ 4 = 1$
- $8 ÷ 4 = 2$
- $12 ÷ 4 = 3$
- $16 ÷ 4 = 4$
- $20 ÷ 4 = 5$

#### Division Facts for 5

- $5 ÷ 5 = 1$
- $10 ÷ 5 = 2$
- $15 ÷ 5 = 3$
- $20 ÷ 5 = 4$
- $25 ÷ 5 = 5$

#### Practice Problems

1. Calculate $18 \div 3$. What is the quotient?
2. If 20 candies are shared among 5 children equally, how many candies does each child receive?
3. Find the result of $12 \div 4$.
4. A pizza is divided into 4 equal parts. How many parts will 2 pizzas have in total?
5. What is $9 \div 3$?
6. How many times does 2 fit into 10?
7. Divide 16 by 4 and write down the answer.
8. You have a ribbon that is 5 meters long. If each piece cut from it is 1 meter long, how many pieces will you have?

Understanding these basic division facts will provide a strong foundation for more advanced mathematical calculations and real-world problem-solving scenarios.
