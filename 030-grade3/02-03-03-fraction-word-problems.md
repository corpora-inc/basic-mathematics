### Fraction Word Problems

In this lesson, we explore how to solve word problems involving fractions. Understanding how to apply fractions to real-world scenarios is a vital step in mastering mathematics and can help with tasks such as cooking, crafting, and budgeting.

#### Solving Word Problems with Fractions

When faced with a word problem involving fractions, it is important to follow a systematic approach:

1. **Read the Problem Carefully**: Understand what is being asked. Identify the fractions involved and what needs to be solved.

2. **Identify Key Information**: Look for words that indicate fraction operations, such as "of," "times," and "share."

3. **Choose the Correct Operation**: Determine whether you need to add, subtract, multiply, or divide the fractions to solve the problem.

4. **Perform the Calculation**: Carry out the appropriate mathematical operations on the fractions as determined in the previous step.

5. **Check Your Work**: Review the problem and your solution to ensure accuracy and that the solution makes sense in context.

#### Example Problems

Let's work through some example problems:

**Example 1:**
One-half of a pizza is left, and you want to divide it equally among 3 friends. How much pizza does each friend get?

**Solution:**
- The fraction of the pizza left is $\frac{1}{2}$.
- Divide this fraction by 3 (the number of friends).
- Calculation: $\frac{1}{2} \div 3 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{6}$.
- Each friend gets $\frac{1}{6}$ of the pizza.

**Example 2:**
A recipe requires $\frac{3}{4}$ cup of sugar, but you only want to make half of the recipe. How much sugar do you need?

**Solution:**
- The fraction of sugar required is $\frac{3}{4}$.
- Multiply by $\frac{1}{2}$ to find half of the amount.
- Calculation: $\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{8}$.
- You need $\frac{3}{8}$ cup of sugar.

#### Practice Problems

1. You have $\frac{2}{3}$ of a cake left, and you wish to share it equally among 4 people. How much cake will each person receive?

2. A piece of ribbon $\frac{5}{6}$ meter long needs to be cut into 5 equal pieces. What is the length of each piece?

3. Linda has $\frac{3}{5}$ of a liter of juice. She drinks $\frac{2}{5}$ of it. How much juice does she have left?

4. A school needs $\frac{7}{8}$ of a pound of clay for an art project. They decide to use only $\frac{2}{3}$ of this amount. How much clay will they use?

5. A farmer has $\frac{4}{5}$ of a field planted with corn. He decides to plant $\frac{1}{4}$ of the remaining field with wheat. What fraction of the field is planted with wheat?

6. A recipe calls for $\frac{2}{3}$ cup of flour. If you want to make half the recipe, how much flour do you need?

7. A group of friends orders a pizza. If each person eats $\frac{1}{4}$ of the pizza, and there are 8 people in the group, how much pizza will each person eat?

8. A baker uses $\frac{3}{5}$ of a bag of flour to make bread. If the bag contains 10 kg of flour, how many kilograms of flour does the baker use?

9. A carpenter cuts a piece of wood into $\frac{1}{3}$-meter-long pieces. If the original piece was 2 meters long, how many pieces does the carpenter get?

10. A store sells $\frac{3}{4}$ of a box of chocolates. If the box contains 24 chocolates, how many chocolates are sold?
