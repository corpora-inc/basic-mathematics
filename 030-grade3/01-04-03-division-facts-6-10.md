### Division Facts 6-10

In this lesson, we focus on division facts involving the numbers 6 through 10. Understanding these facts is essential for solving more complex mathematical problems involving division.

#### Division Facts for 6

Dividing by 6 is equivalent to grouping items into sets of 6. For example, when dividing 30 by 6, you are determining how many groups of 6 can be formed from 30 items.

- **30 ÷ 6 = 5**: Thirty divided by six equals five.
- **60 ÷ 6 = 10**: Sixty divided by six equals ten.

> **Key Insight**: When dividing by 6, if the dividend is a multiple of 6, the quotient will also be a whole number.

#### Division Facts for 7

Dividing by 7 involves arranging items into groups of 7. This is often seen in real-world scenarios like organizing weeks (7 days) or collections.

- **35 ÷ 7 = 5**: Thirty-five divided by seven equals five.
- **49 ÷ 7 = 7**: Forty-nine divided by seven equals seven.

> **Application**: Understanding how to divide by 7 can assist with quick calculations, such as determining how many weeks fit into a certain number of days.

#### Division Facts for 8

Division by 8 requires arranging items into sets of 8. This can be useful in tasks such as distributing items evenly or understanding spatial arrangements.

- **40 ÷ 8 = 5**: Forty divided by eight equals five.
- **64 ÷ 8 = 8**: Sixty-four divided by eight equals eight.

> **Example**: If you have 64 pieces of fruit and want to pack them into bags of 8 pieces each, you will fill 8 bags.

> **Trivia**: Nine is the highest single-digit number, and dividing whole numbers by 9 often results in single-digit quotients.

#### Division Facts for 10

Dividing by 10 is one of the more straightforward operations due to our base-10 number system. It involves shifting the decimal point to the left by one place.

- **50 ÷ 10 = 5**: Fifty divided by ten equals five.
- **100 ÷ 10 = 10**: One hundred divided by ten equals ten.

> **Practical Use**: This is commonly applied in monetary transactions, where dividing by 10 may help with tasks such as calculating change or breaking down costs.
