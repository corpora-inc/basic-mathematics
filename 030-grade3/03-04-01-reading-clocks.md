### Reading Clocks

Understanding how to read clocks is an essential skill in daily life. Being able to tell time allows us to organize our activities, meet schedules, and coordinate with others. In this lesson, we will learn how to read both analog and digital clocks effectively.

#### Analog Clocks

An analog clock has a circular face with numbers from 1 to 12 arranged clockwise. It also has two or three hands:

- **Hour Hand**: This is the shorter hand, indicating the current hour.
- **Minute Hand**: The longer hand, which points to the minutes.
- **Second Hand**: Sometimes present, this hand moves continuously and marks the seconds.

Each number on the clock represents an hour. The entire clock face is divided into 60 sections, each representing a minute. Understanding this layout helps in determining the exact time.

> **Example**: If the hour hand is on 3 and the minute hand is on 12, it reads 3:00. If the minute hand is on 6, it’s 30 minutes past 3, or 3:30.

#### Reading the Time

1. **Identify the Hour**: Look where the hour hand is pointing. If it's between two numbers, the time is the earlier number.
2. **Identify the Minutes**: See where the minute hand is pointing. Each number on the clock face is worth 5 minutes. If the minute hand points to 1, it’s 5 minutes past the hour, and if it points to 2, it’s 10 minutes past.
3. **Combine Them**: State the complete time by combining the hour and minute.

> **Example**: If the hour hand is between 4 and 5 and the minute hand is on 3, the time is 4:15.

#### Digital Clocks

Digital clocks display time with numbers. They typically show four digits, separated by a colon, indicating hours and minutes (e.g., 09:45).

- **Hours**: Displayed on the left side of the colon.
- **Minutes**: Displayed on the right side of the colon.

Digital clocks simplify the process of reading time as they directly show the time in numerical format.

> **Example**: The digital time '07:20' is read as seven twenty.


#### Practice Problems

1. On an analog clock, the hour hand is on 9 and the minute hand is on 6. What time is it?
2. If the minute hand is pointing at 10 and the hour hand is between 2 and 3, what time does the clock show?
3. Convert the digital time 11:45 to an analog clock description.
4. How would you write 'half-past seven' in digital time?
5. Illustrate a time 3:25 on an analog clock drawing, identifying the position of the hour and minute hands.
