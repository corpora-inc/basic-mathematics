### Mixed Numbers

#### Understanding Mixed Numbers

A mixed number consists of a whole number and a fraction combined. Mixed numbers are commonly used to express amounts greater than a whole but not reaching another whole. For example, if you have 2 whole pizzas and half of another pizza, you could express this as the mixed number $2\frac{1}{2}$.

- **Whole Number**: Represents the complete parts or units you have. In $2\frac{1}{2}$, the whole number is 2.
- **Fraction**: Represents the remaining parts that are less than a whole. In $2\frac{1}{2}$, the fraction is $\frac{1}{2}$.

#### Converting Mixed Numbers to Improper Fractions

To perform calculations with mixed numbers, it is often necessary to convert them to improper fractions. An improper fraction has a numerator larger than its denominator.

**Steps to Convert a Mixed Number to an Improper Fraction:**

1. Multiply the whole number by the denominator of the fractional part.
2. Add the result to the numerator of the fractional part.
3. The sum becomes the new numerator, and the original denominator remains.

**Example:** Convert $3\frac{2}{5}$ to an improper fraction.

- Multiply the whole number by the denominator: $3 \times 5 = 15$.
- Add the numerator: $15 + 2 = 17$.
- The improper fraction is $\frac{17}{5}$.

#### Converting Improper Fractions to Mixed Numbers

To convert an improper fraction back into a mixed number:

1. Divide the numerator by the denominator.
2. The quotient becomes the whole number.
3. The remainder becomes the new numerator, with the original denominator.

**Example:** Convert $\frac{22}{7}$ to a mixed number.

- Divide 22 by 7, which equals 3 with a remainder of 1.
- The mixed number is $3\frac{1}{7}$.

#### Real-World Applications

Mixed numbers are used frequently in daily life. They are helpful when measuring ingredients in cooking, such as when a recipe requires $1\frac{3}{4}$ cups of flour. In construction, measurements often involve mixed numbers, like when a piece of wood needs to be $2\frac{1}{2}$ feet long.

#### Practice Problems

1. Convert the mixed number $5\frac{3}{8}$ into an improper fraction.
2. Change the improper fraction $\frac{29}{4}$ to a mixed number.
3. You have baked $3\frac{1}{2}$ dozen cookies. Write this amount as an improper fraction.
4. Convert the improper fraction $\frac{45}{6}$ into a mixed number.
5. A plank of wood measures $4\frac{2}{3}$ feet in length. Express this as an improper fraction.
