### Fractions Between Whole Numbers

Fractions are a way to express parts of a whole. Understanding how fractions fit on the number line between whole numbers is a key skill in mathematics. This section will explore how fractions can be positioned between whole numbers and how they can represent values less and greater than 1.

#### Understanding the Number Line

A number line is a straight line with numbers placed at equal intervals along its length. It helps visualize numbers, including whole numbers and fractions. Whole numbers are represented by integers such as 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on.

Fractions, such as $\frac{1}{2}$ or $\frac{3}{4}$, are placed between these whole numbers. For instance, $\frac{1}{2}$ is exactly halfway between 0 and 1 on the number line.

#### Positioning Fractions

To position a fraction correctly on a number line, consider the numerator and the denominator:

- **Numerator**: Indicates how many parts you have.
- **Denominator**: Shows how many equal parts the whole is divided into.

For example, $\frac{3}{5}$ means dividing the section between 0 and 1 into 5 equal parts and counting 3 of those parts. Thus, $\frac{3}{5}$ is positioned between 0 and 1, closer to 1 than $\frac{1}{2}$.

#### Fractions Greater Than 1

When a fraction like $\frac{5}{3}$ has a numerator greater than its denominator, it is greater than 1. On a number line, $\frac{5}{3}$ is placed past the whole number 1. To locate it:

1. Divide the section between 0 and 1 into 3 equal parts (since the denominator is 3).
2. Beyond 1, count an additional 2 parts (since 3 parts make 1 whole, you count 2 more for $\frac{5}{3}$).

Hence, $\frac{5}{3}$ is positioned past 1 but less than 2.

#### Real-World Applications

Understanding fractions between whole numbers is used in various real-life situations:

- When cooking, measurements like $\frac{1}{4}$ cup or $\frac{3}{4}$ teaspoon are common.
- In construction, precise measures are critical, where fractions determine material lengths and quantities.
- In finance, fractions are used to represent interest rates or stock market values.

#### Practice Problems

1. Place the following fractions on a number line between 0 and 2: $\frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{5}{4}, \frac{7}{4}$.
2. Which is larger, $\frac{2}{3}$ or $\frac{3}{5}$? Use a number line to prove your answer.
3. Represent $\frac{9}{4}$ on a number line. Identify the whole numbers it falls between.
4. On a number line, what fraction is exactly halfway between 1 and 2?
5. Discuss how you might use fractions in a project at home, like building a bookshelf or baking a cake.
