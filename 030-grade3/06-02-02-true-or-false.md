### True or False

In the study of logic and reasoning, it is essential to understand the concept of statements being either true or false. This lesson will focus on distinguishing between true and false statements, which is a fundamental aspect of logical reasoning and everyday decision-making.

#### Understanding True and False Statements

A statement is a sentence that declares something that can be either true or false, not both. Statements are used extensively in logical arguments, mathematics, and everyday conversations. By analyzing whether a statement is true or false, we can better understand its validity and make informed decisions.

- **True Statement**: A statement that accurately reflects reality or facts. For example, "The Earth revolves around the Sun" is a true statement.
- **False Statement**: A statement that does not accurately reflect reality or facts. For example, "The Earth is flat" is a false statement.

#### Real-World Applications

Understanding whether a statement is true or false is crucial in a variety of real-world situations:
- **Science**: Scientists use experiments to test hypotheses and determine whether certain statements about the natural world are true or false.
- **Law**: Lawyers and judges must assess statements to establish the truth in legal cases.
- **Everyday Decisions**: We constantly evaluate information to make daily decisions, such as determining whether a weather forecast is accurate.

#### Practice Problems

1. Identify whether the following statement is true or false: "Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius at sea level."
2. Consider the statement: "All birds can fly." Determine if this is true or false, and explain your reasoning.
3. Evaluate the truth of this statement: "Adding two even numbers will always result in an odd number."
4. Decide if the following statement is true or false: "New York City is the capital of the United States."
5. Analyze this statement: "A square is a rectangle." Determine its truth and explain why.

These exercises will help you practice distinguishing between true and false statements, a skill that is valuable both in academics and in everyday life.
