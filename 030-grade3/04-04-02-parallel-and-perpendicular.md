### Parallel and Perpendicular Lines

Understanding parallel and perpendicular lines is a fundamental concept in geometry that allows us to analyze shapes, patterns, and structures in various fields, including engineering, design, and architecture.

#### Parallel Lines

Parallel lines are lines in a plane that never meet. No matter how far you extend them in either direction, they will not intersect. These lines are always the same distance apart.

> **Definition**: Two lines are parallel if they are in the same plane and do not intersect, no matter how far they extend.

**Example of Parallel Lines**:

- The opposite edges of a rectangle or a piece of paper are parallel.
- Railway tracks are parallel to ensure trains run smoothly.

In diagrams, parallel lines are often denoted by arrows (`→→`) showing they run in the same direction.

#### Perpendicular Lines

Perpendicular lines are lines that intersect at a right angle (90 degrees). This property makes them significant in creating grids and designing objects.

> **Definition**: Two lines are perpendicular if they intersect at a 90-degree angle.

**Example of Perpendicular Lines**:

- The edges of a book are perpendicular to each other.
- Street intersections are commonly perpendicular to organize traffic flow.

When drawing, perpendicular lines are shown as intersecting with a small square at the corner, indicating the right angle.

#### Real-World Applications

- **Architecture**: Buildings and rooms often use parallel and perpendicular lines in their design for aesthetics and structural balance.
- **Maps**: Streets and grids on maps show parallel and perpendicular lines to indicate routes and connections.
- **Art**: Artists use these lines to create perspective, depth, and realism in their artwork.

#### Practice Problems

1. Draw two sets of parallel lines and label them.
2. Identify at least three real-life examples of parallel lines around you.
3. Draw two lines that are perpendicular and show the right angle.
4. Using graph paper, create a pattern using both parallel and perpendicular lines. What shapes do you observe?
5. Consider a rectangle: explain how its sides are parallel and perpendicular to each other.
