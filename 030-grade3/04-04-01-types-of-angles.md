### Types of Angles

Angles are a fundamental concept in geometry, defining how two lines meet at a point. Understanding different types of angles helps in various applications, from designing buildings to solving everyday problems. Angles are measured in degrees (°).

#### Classification of Angles

1. **Acute Angles**
   - An angle measuring less than 90°.
   - Example: The hands of a clock at 10:00 form an acute angle.

2. **Right Angles**
   - An angle measuring exactly 90°.
   - Recognizable in corners of squares and rectangles.

3. **Obtuse Angles**
   - An angle measuring more than 90° but less than 180°.
   - Example: A book slightly opened forms an obtuse angle.

4. **Straight Angles**
   - An angle measuring precisely 180°.
   - Resembles a straight line.

5. **Reflex Angles**
   - An angle measuring more than 180° but less than 360°.
   - The larger angle in a pizza slice when you eat a bigger portion.

6. **Full Rotation**
   - An angle measuring exactly 360°.
   - Represents a complete turn.

#### Real-World Applications

- **Construction**: In constructing buildings, right angles are crucial for stability.
- **Art and Design**: Artists use angles to create perspective in paintings.
- **Navigation**: Understanding angles is vital in navigation, such as setting a course at sea.

#### Practice Problems

1. Identify the types of angles in the following shapes: triangle, square, and pentagon.
2. Draw an example of an obtuse angle and a right angle.
3. If an angle is 47°, classify its type and provide a real-world example of a similar angle.
4. Explain the significance of right angles in architecture.
5. Measure an angle in your classroom, classify it, and describe its importance or function.
