## Solid Shapes

In this section, we explore solid shapes, also known as three-dimensional shapes, which have depth in addition to length and width. Understanding these shapes is essential as they appear everywhere in our daily life, from the objects we use to the buildings we live in.

**Key Concepts**

- **Solid Shapes**: These include a variety of forms such as cubes, cylinders, cones, spheres, and more. Each shape has its own properties that define its structure.

- **Properties of Solid Shapes**: Discussion of characteristics such as faces, edges, and vertices. Different shapes have different numbers of these features, helping to classify and understand them.

- **Real-World Applications**: Recognition of these shapes in everyday objectsâ€”cans as cylinders, dice as cubes, and so on. Understanding these shapes can enhance spatial awareness and problem-solving skills.

Solid shapes are foundational in geometry and are important for various applications in engineering, architecture, and design, making this knowledge both practical and broadly applicable.
