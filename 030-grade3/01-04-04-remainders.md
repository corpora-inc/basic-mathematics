### Remainders

In mathematics, division is an operation used to find out how many times one number is contained within another. However, sometimes numbers do not divide perfectly. When this happens, we have a "remainder." A remainder is the amount left over after division.

#### Understanding Remainders

Consider the division of 14 by 4. When we divide 14 by 4, 4 goes into 14 three times because $4 \times 3 = 12$. After multiplying, we subtract 12 from 14, leaving us with 2. This leftover amount, 2, is called the remainder. We can express this division as:

$$
14 \div 4 = 3 \, \text{remainder} \, 2
$$

Here, 3 is the quotient, and 2 is the remainder.

#### Importance of Remainders

Remainders are crucial in various real-world applications. For example, if you are packing boxes with a fixed number of items and find that some items are left over, the number left out is the remainder. Remainders also appear in programming, cryptography, and logistics.

#### More Examples of Remainders

1. **Example 1**: Divide 20 by 6.
   - 6 goes into 20 three times (since $6 \times 3 = 18$), and 2 is left. Therefore, 20 divided by 6 is 3, remainder 2.

2. **Example 2**: Divide 31 by 5.
   - 5 goes into 31 six times (since $5 \times 6 = 30$), and 1 is left over. Thus, 31 divided by 5 is 6, remainder 1.

3. **Example 3**: Divide 45 by 7.
   - 7 goes into 45 six times (since $7 \times 6 = 42$), and 3 remains. Therefore, 45 divided by 7 is 6, remainder 3.

#### Practice Problems

1. Divide 22 by 4 and find the remainder.
2. Divide 37 by 6 and determine the remainder.
3. Divide 53 by 8 and identify the remainder.
4. If 11 is divided by 3, what is the remainder?
5. Divide 29 by 5 and find the remainder.
