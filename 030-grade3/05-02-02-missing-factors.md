### Missing Factors

#### Understanding Factors

In multiplication, a factor is a number that is multiplied by another number to get a product. For instance, in the multiplication sentence $3 \times 4 = 12$, the numbers 3 and 4 are factors of the product 12.

> **Definition:** A factor is a whole number that can be multiplied by another whole number to get a product.

Identifying missing factors is an essential skill in solving multiplication problems, especially when working with factor pairs to achieve a specific product.

#### Finding Missing Factors

To find a missing factor in a multiplication equation, you can use division. For example, if you know the product and one factor, you can find the other factor by dividing the product by the known factor.

**Example:**

Suppose you have the equation $5 \times ? = 20$. To find the missing factor, divide the product (20) by the known factor (5):

$$
? = 20 \div 5 = 4
$$

Thus, the missing factor is 4.

#### Real-World Application

Understanding and finding missing factors can be useful in daily life. For instance, if you need to divide items evenly among a group, you can use factors to understand how many people can equally share the items. This concept is fundamental in dividing resources properly and efficiently.

#### Practice Problems

1. Find the missing factor: $6 \times ? = 42$.
2. Determine the missing factor: $? \times 9 = 81$.
3. Identify the unknown factor: $? \times 7 = 56$.
4. Calculate the missing factor: $8 \times ? = 64$.
5. Fill in the missing factor: $? \times 12 = 60$.
