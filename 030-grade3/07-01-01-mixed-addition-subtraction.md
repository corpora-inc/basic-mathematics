### Mixed Addition and Subtraction

In this lesson, we will explore mixed addition and subtraction, which involves solving problems that require you to both add and subtract numbers. This skill is essential for handling complex mathematical scenarios and understanding real-world applications where various operations occur simultaneously.

#### Understanding Mixed Operations

Mixed addition and subtraction combines both types of operations in one problem. It is crucial to practice these exercises to strengthen mental arithmetic and problem-solving skills. 

Consider the problem: 

> "If you have 35 candies, and you first get 15 more, but then give away 10, how many candies do you have now?"

To solve this, perform the following steps:
1. **Add:** Start with 35 candies and add 15 more: 
   $$35 + 15 = 50$$
2. **Subtract:** Then subtract the 10 candies given away:
   $$50 - 10 = 40$$

You will have 40 candies left.


#### Key Concepts

- **Order of Operations:** Solving mixed addition and subtraction problems generally follows a left-to-right approach unless parenthesis dictate otherwise. Such clarity is essential when facing equations with multiple steps.
- **Word Problems:** Translating words into mathematical equations is a common use-case for mixed operations. Understanding keywords can help determine which operations to use.


#### Examples

1. **Example 1**: Calculate the result of $23 + 17 - 9$.
   - First, add $23$ and $17$: $$23 + 17 = 40$$
   - Then subtract $9$: $$40 - 9 = 31$$
   - The final result is $31$.

2. **Example 2**: Evaluate the expression $60 - 25 + 15$.
   - Start by subtracting $25$ from $60$: $$60 - 25 = 35$$
   - Then add $15$: $$35 + 15 = 50$$
   - The answer is $50$.


#### Practice Problems

Solve the following mixed addition and subtraction problems. Show your work step by step.

1. $47 + 22 - 14 = $
2. $52 - 18 + 33 = $
3. $30 + 16 - 8 = $
4. $100 - 47 - 5 = $
5. $29 + 31 + 40 - 20 = $

By practicing these problems, you will improve your ability to handle equations that require more than one step and better understand how addition and subtraction work together.
