### Three-Digit Subtraction

Three-digit subtraction is an essential skill that builds on the fundamentals of subtraction with smaller numbers, enabling more complex calculations. It involves subtracting one three-digit number from another, often requiring borrowing (regrouping) to complete the calculation accurately.

#### Steps for Three-Digit Subtraction

To perform three-digit subtraction, follow these steps carefully.

1. **Subtract the Units Column:**

   - Look at the digits in the units place (the right-most digits) of both numbers.
   - If the top digit is larger than or equal to the bottom digit, subtract the bottom digit from the top digit.
   - If not, borrow from the tens column. This means taking one group of ten from the tens place, turning it into 10 units, and adding it to the units column on top. Remember to reduce the tens column's digit by one.

   - Example:

     $$
     \begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}
        & &   &   &  \\
        & & 5 & 4 & 6 \\
     -  & & 3 & 7 & 8 \\
     \hline
        & &   &   &  \\
     \end{array}
     $$

   - Here, 6 is smaller than 8, so borrow 1 ten from the tens column. The tens digit 4 becomes 3, and the units digit becomes 16, allowing you to subtract 8 from 16.
   - The units column becomes $16 - 8 = 8$.

   $$
   \begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}
      & &   &   &  \\
      & & 5 & 3 & (16) \\
   -  & & 3 & 7 & 8 \\
   \hline
      & &   &   & 8 \\
   \end{array}
   $$

2. **Subtract the Tens Column:**

   - Move to the tens column. Ensure any borrowing done previously is accounted for by reducing the digit in the tens place if necessary.
   - Since 3 < 7, borrow from the hundreds column to make the tens column 13.

   - Continued Example:

     $$
       \begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}
         & &   &   &  \\
         & & 4 & (13) & (16) \\
         - & & 3 & 7 & 8 \\
         \hline
         & &  & 6 & 8 \\
         \end{array}
       $$

3. **Subtract the Hundreds Column:**

   - Finally, subtract the hundreds digit of the bottom number from the top number.
   - Since $4 > 3$, subtract 3 from 4 to get 1.
   - With Borrowing:

       $$
       \begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}
         & &   &   &  \\
         & & 4 & (13) & (16) \\
       -  & & 3 & 7 & 8 \\
       \hline
         & & 1 & 6 & 8 \\
       \end{array}
       $$
   - In Summary:

      $$
      \begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}
         & &   &   &  \\
         & & 5 & 4 & 6 \\
      -  & & 3 & 7 & 8 \\
      \hline
         & & 1 & 6 & 8 \\
      \end{array}
      $$

4. **Check Your Answer:**

   - Verify your answer by adding the result to the number you subtracted. The sum should equal the original number you started with.

   $$546 - 378 = 168$$

   $$168 + 378 = 546$$

#### Practice Problems

Try these subtraction problems to practice your skills. Write down your calculations and make sure to check each step.

1. Subtract $759$ from $893$.
2. Subtract $648$ from $753$.
3. Subtract $506$ from $689$.
4. Subtract $372$ from $801$.
5. Subtract $284$ from $569$.

Solving three-digit subtraction problems will help solidify your understanding and improve your ability to handle more complex calculations in your daily life. These skills are useful in many real-world situations like budgeting, cooking recipes, and measuring distances, where precise calculations are crucial.
