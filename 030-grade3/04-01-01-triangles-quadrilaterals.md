### Triangles and Quadrilaterals

Triangles and quadrilaterals are foundational shapes in geometry. Understanding their properties helps students recognize these shapes in the world around them and enhances their problem-solving skills.

#### Triangles

A triangle is a three-sided polygon. The sum of the angles in a triangle is always $180^\circ$. Triangles can be classified based on their side lengths and angles:

- **Equilateral Triangle**: All sides are equal, and all angles are $60^\circ$.
- **Isosceles Triangle**: Two sides are equal, and the angles opposite these sides are equal.
- **Scalene Triangle**: All sides and angles are different.
- **Right Triangle**: Has one $90^\circ$ angle.

Understanding triangles is crucial in fields such as engineering and architecture, where they often provide structural stability.

#### Quadrilaterals

Quadrilaterals are four-sided polygons and include a variety of different shapes. The sum of the angles in any quadrilateral is $360^\circ$. Here are some common types:

- **Square**: Four equal sides and four right angles.
- **Rectangle**: Opposite sides are equal and four right angles.
- **Rhombus**: Four equal sides with opposite equal angles.
- **Parallelogram**: Opposite sides are equal and parallel.
- **Trapezoid**: Only one pair of parallel sides.

Quadrilaterals are found in everyday objects such as books, tables, and screens, making them important for understanding design and functionality.

#### Practice Problems

1. Draw an equilateral triangle and label its sides and angles.
2. Identify two real-world objects that resemble a rectangle.
3. In a scalene triangle, if one angle is $40^\circ$ and another is $70^\circ$, what is the third angle?
4. Compare and contrast a square and a rectangle. What are the similarities and differences?
5. Find a quadrilateral in your home and describe its type by checking its sides and angles.
