### Finding Area

Area is a measure of the space inside a two-dimensional shape, such as a square or rectangle. Understanding how to calculate area is essential for many real-world applications, such as determining how much paint is needed for a wall or how much carpet is required for a room.

#### Calculating Area of Squares and Rectangles

To find the area of a square or a rectangle, you can use the following formulas:

- **Square**: The area of a square is given by the formula $A = s \times s$ or $A = s^2$, where $s$ is the length of a side.
- **Rectangle**: The area of a rectangle is given by the formula $A = l \times w$, where $l$ is the length and $w$ is the width.

**Example**: Calculate the area of a rectangle with a length of 5 meters and a width of 3 meters.

Using the formula $A = l \times w$, we find:

$$
A = 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ square meters}
$$

#### Real-World Applications

- **Home Decoration**: Knowing the area of a room is necessary when buying flooring or planning a layout.
- **Gardening**: Calculating the area of a garden bed helps in determining the amount of materials needed.

#### Practice Problems

1. Find the area of a square with side length 4 cm.
2. A rectangular garden is 8 meters long and 6 meters wide. What is its area?
3. If a room is 10 feet long and 12 feet wide, how much carpet is needed to cover the floor?
4. Calculate the area of a rectangle with a length of 7 inches and a width of 4 inches.

Practicing these calculations will help solidify your understanding of finding area, a valuable skill in both personal and professional contexts.
