### Naming Fractions

Naming fractions is a fundamental skill in understanding mathematics that involves recognizing parts of a whole. A fraction consists of two numbers, separated by a line: the numerator and the denominator. Understanding this concept helps in interpreting quantities such as half a pizza or a quarter of a dollar.

#### Understanding Numerator and Denominator

- **Numerator**: The top number in a fraction, representing how many parts are being considered.
- **Denominator**: The bottom number in a fraction, indicating the total number of equal parts the whole is divided into.

For example, in the fraction $\frac{3}{4}$:
- The numerator is 3, meaning three parts are taken.
- The denominator is 4, meaning the whole is divided into four equal parts.

#### Real-World Application

Fractions are used in everyday life, such as when dividing food, calculating discounts, or converting units of measurement. Understanding how to name fractions accurately can help in making informed decisions.

#### Practice Problems

1. Write the fraction for a pie that is divided into 8 equal parts, and 5 parts are eaten.
2. If you have a chocolate bar divided into 12 pieces and you give away 3 pieces, what fraction of the chocolate bar do you still have?
3. A team has 9 players. If 6 players are wearing red shirts, what fraction of the team is wearing red?
4. In a class of 24 students, 18 are present today. What fraction of the class is present?
5. A recipe calls for 2 cups of milk. If you only have 1 cup, what fraction of the required milk do you have?
