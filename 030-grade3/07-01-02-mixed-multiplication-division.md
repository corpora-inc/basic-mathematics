### Mixed Multiplication and Division

In this lesson, we will explore how multiplication and division are intimately linked and how understanding one can reinforce your understanding of the other. These operations are crucial for solving problems involving grouping and sharing quantities.

#### Multiplication and Division Relationship

- **Multiplication** is the process of adding a number to itself a certain number of times. For example, $4 \times 3$ means adding the number 4 three times, resulting in 12.
- **Division** is essentially the inverse of multiplication. It involves determining how many times a number is contained within another number. For example, $12 \div 4$ asks how many groups of 4 are in 12, which results in 3.

The connection between these two operations can be seen clearly when solving division problems: 
- If $a \times b = c$, then $c \div b = a$.

#### Real-World Applications
- **Cooking**: If a recipe requires 3 times as much flour, you use multiplication to determine the total. If you need to divide dough into equal portions, division will help.
- **Sharing**: In sharing problems, division helps distribute items equally, and multiplication can confirm totals.
- **Construction**: Knowing how many tiles cover a floor uses multiplication, while dividing can determine how materials are split for use in multiple areas.

#### Examples

1. **Multiplication Example**: Calculate $7 \times 5$.
   - $7$ added to itself $5$ times is $35$.

2. **Division Example**: Calculate $35 \div 7$.
   - Determine how many times $7$ fits into $35$. The result is $5$.

3. **Mixed Problem**: If there are 24 candies and they are divided into bags containing 6 candies each, how many bags are there?
   - Using division: $24 \div 6 = 4$ bags.

#### Practice Problems

1. Calculate $8 \times 6$.
2. Find the result of $42 \div 7$.
3. If a rectangular garden is divided into 9 equal sections and there are 45 plants in total, how many plants are in each section?
4. You have 56 marbles, and you want to place them in containers, each holding 8 marbles. How many containers can you fill?
5. Think of a real-world scenario where both multiplication and division might be used together. Write a word problem for this scenario and solve it.
