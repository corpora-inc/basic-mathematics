### Grams and Kilograms

In this lesson, we will explore the units of grams and kilograms, which are used to measure weight and mass. Understanding these units is essential for interpreting a wide range of scientific data and for performing everyday tasks like cooking or shipping.

#### Understanding Grams and Kilograms

- **Grams (g)**: A gram is the base unit of mass in the metric system. It is typically used to measure light objects. For example, a paperclip weighs about 1 gram.
- **Kilograms (kg)**: A kilogram is equal to 1,000 grams and is used for measuring heavier objects. A standard textbook might weigh about 1 kilogram.

The metric system is convenient because it is based on powers of ten, making conversion straightforward.

> **Key Insight**: The metric system simplifies conversions because it is decimal-based, unlike some other systems that require more complex calculations.

#### Real-World Applications

Grams and kilograms are commonly used in:

- **Cooking**: Recipes often require precise measurements of ingredients in grams or kilograms, ensuring consistency and taste.
- **Science and Medicine**: Medication dosages might be measured in milligrams (1/1000 of a gram), requiring an understanding of grams and kilograms for larger measurements.
- **Commerce**: Shipping and packaging often involve weighing products in kilograms for transport efficiency.

#### Example Calculations

1. **Converting Grams to Kilograms**:
   - **Problem**: Convert 2,500 grams to kilograms.
   - **Solution**: 
     $$
     \text{Kilograms} = \frac{\text{Grams}}{1,000} = \frac{2,500}{1,000} = 2.5 \text{ kg}
     $$

2. **Comparing Weights**:
   - **Problem**: If an apple weighs 150 grams and a watermelon weighs 4 kilograms, which fruit is heavier and by how many grams?
   - **Solution**: 
     First, convert 4 kg to grams: 
     $$
     4 \text{ kg} \times 1,000 = 4,000 \text{ grams}
     $$
     Then, subtract the weight of the apple: 
     $$
     4,000 \text{ grams} - 150 \text{ grams} = 3,850 \text{ grams}
     $$
     The watermelon is 3,850 grams heavier.

#### Practice Problems

1. Convert 3 kilograms into grams.
2. A bag of rice weighs 5,000 grams. Express its weight in kilograms.
3. A suitcase weighs 15 kilograms. How many grams does it weigh?
4. You buy a box of sponges. Each sponge weighs 20 grams, and the box contains 50 sponges. What is the total weight in kilograms?
5. A truck can carry a maximum of 2,000 kilograms. If each filled container weighs 250 kilograms, how many containers can the truck carry?
