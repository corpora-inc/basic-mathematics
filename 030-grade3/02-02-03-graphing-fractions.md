### Graphing Fractions

Understanding how to graph fractions provides a visual representation of where these numbers lie in relation to whole numbers and each other on a number line. This skill is essential in comparing fractions and grasping their sizes.

#### The Number Line

A number line extends infinitely in both directions, showing whole numbers, fractions, and decimals. The fractions are placed between the whole numbers.

1. Draw a straight horizontal line and mark evenly spaced points along it.
2. Label these points with whole numbers (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.).

#### Locating Fractions on the Number Line

To graph a fraction like $\frac{1}{2}$ between 0 and 1:

1. Divide the segment between 0 and 1 into as many equal parts as the fraction's denominator (for $\frac{1}{2}$, divide into 2 parts).
2. Count the number of parts indicated by the numerator from 0. For $\frac{1}{2}$, this means moving to the first mark.
3. Mark the point on the line and label it as $\frac{1}{2}$.

Example: To graph $\frac{3}{4}$ on a number line:

- First, identify the segment between 0 and 1.
- Divide it into 4 equal parts.
- Count 3 parts from 0.
- Mark and label the point $\frac{3}{4}$.

#### Examples

- **Graph $\frac{1}{3}$**: Divide the segment between 0 and 1 into 3 equal parts. Mark the first section as $\frac{1}{3}$.

- **Graph $\frac{5}{6}$**: Divide the segment between 0 and 1 into 6 equal parts. Count and mark the fifth section.

- **Graph $1\frac{1}{2}$**: Locate 1 on the number line. Then, divide the segment between 1 and 2 into 2 equal parts. Count one step beyond 1 and mark it as $1\frac{1}{2}$.

#### Real-world Applications

Graphing fractions is useful in diverse settings:

- **Cooking**: When measuring ingredients, fractions on measuring cups are often shown using a number line.
- **Construction**: Builders use measurements that need fractions.
- **Data Analysis**: Fractions on graphs help in interpreting data.

#### Practice Problems

1. **Graph $\frac{2}{5}$ on a number line.**
2. **Locate and mark $\frac{7}{8}$.**
3. **Draw a number line and represent $\frac{1}{4}$, $\frac{3}{4}$, and $\frac{1}{2}$.**
4. **Place $1\frac{3}{4}$ on a number line.**
5. **Sketch a line and indicate $\frac{2}{3}$ between 0 and 1.**
