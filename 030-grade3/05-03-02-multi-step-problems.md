### Multi-Step Problems

Solving multi-step problems requires a clear understanding of the situation and an organized approach to finding a solution. These problems often reflect real-life scenarios where several calculations are necessary to reach a final answer.

#### Understanding Multi-Step Problems

In a multi-step problem, you must carefully identify and perform multiple mathematical operations to solve the entire problem. Typically, these involve a combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. 

> **Key Insight**: Multi-step problems test your ability to think logically and use various math operations sequentially.

To effectively tackle these problems, follow these steps:

1. **Read the Entire Problem**: Initial reading and comprehension are crucial. Understand what is being asked before attempting to solve it.
2. **Identify What You Know**: Determine the information given and what is required for the solution.
3. **Choose a Strategy**: Decide which operations will help solve each part of the problem.
4. **Solve Step by Step**: Work through each part in order, double-checking the accuracy of each solution.
5. **Review the Solution**: Check whether your answer makes sense in the context of the problem.

#### Example of a Multi-Step Problem

**Problem**: You have 5 packs of pencils. Each pack contains 8 pencils. You give 3 pencils to each of your 4 friends. How many pencils do you have left?

1. **Understanding**: You start with packs of pencils and distribute some to friends.
2. **Calculate Total Pencils**:
   - Multiply the number of packs by the number of pencils per pack: 
   $$5 \times 8 = 40$$
3. **Calculate Pencils Given to Friends**:
   - Multiply the number of friends by the pencils each receives:
   $$3 \times 4 = 12$$
4. **Subtract to Find Remaining Pencils**:
   - Subtract the pencils given from the total count:
   $$40 - 12 = 28$$

   So, you have 28 pencils left.

#### Real-World Applications

Understanding multi-step problem solving is essential in numerous real-world contexts:
- **Shopping**: Calculating discounts, sales tax, and total amounts in a purchase.
- **Cooking**: Adjusting recipes based on available ingredients or the number of servings needed.
- **Construction**: Estimating materials needed when working on projects, considering dimensions and layout changes.

#### Practice Problems

1. A school is planning a field trip. There are 12 students in each class, and 5 classes are going. Each student pays $7 for the trip. What is the total amount collected from the students?

2. You are saving for a new bicycle. You save $15 each week for 8 weeks. Then you spend $18 of your savings on a gift. How much do you have left to spend on the bicycle?

3. A farmer collects eggs. Each of his 4 hens lays 3 eggs per day. He sells 18 eggs at the market. How many eggs does he have left at the end of the day?

Approach each problem systematically and ensure accuracy in your calculations.
