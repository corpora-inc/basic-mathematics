## Plane Shapes

Plane shapes are two-dimensional figures that lie flat on a surface, defined by edges, vertices (corners), and sometimes angles. In this subsection, we will explore basic plane shapes and their characteristics, laying the groundwork for understanding more complex geometric concepts.

> **Definition**: A plane shape is a flat, two-dimensional shape that can be drawn on a plane.

### Key Concepts of Plane Shapes

- **Circle**: A round shape with all points at the edge equidistant from the center. It does not have vertices or edges.
- **Triangle**: A shape with three sides and three vertices. Triangles can vary by the length of their sides and the measure of their angles.
- **Square**: A special rectangle with four equal sides and four right angles. It is a type of regular quadrilateral.
- **Rectangle**: A shape with opposite sides equal and four right angles. The sides need not be equal like a square.
- **Polygon**: A closed shape with straight sides. The number of sides can vary.

### Real-World Applications

Understanding plane shapes forms the foundation for geometry, which is used in various fields, such as engineering and design. For example, architects use triangles for structural integrity, while circular shapes might be essential in machinery parts like gears and wheels.

### Practice Problems

1. Draw a triangle, a square, and a rectangle, and label the vertices.
2. Identify the number of sides and corners each of the following shapes has: hexagon, pentagon.
3. Consider a set of objects in the room (e.g., books, clocks, doors). Identify which plane shape best represents each object.
4. Create a simple pattern using a combination of plane shapes such as circles and squares, and describe your pattern.
5. Explain how you would use plane shapes to design a simple object, like a kite.
