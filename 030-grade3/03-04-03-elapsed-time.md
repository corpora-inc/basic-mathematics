### Elapsed Time

Understanding elapsed time involves calculating the amount of time that passes from the start of an event to its end. This skill is crucial for planning daily activities, ensuring punctuality, and efficiently managing schedules.

#### Measuring Elapsed Time

To measure elapsed time, you must understand both the starting and ending times. The difference between these times will give the elapsed time. This can be done by:

1. **Using a Clock**: Determine the start time and the end time on a clock and calculate the time difference.
2. **Using a Timeline**: Draw a timeline where you mark the start and end times and break down hours and minutes.

#### Steps to Calculate Elapsed Time

1. **Identify Start and End Times**: Know the precise time when an event begins and ends.
2. **Count the Hours**: Subtract the start hour from the end hour. If the end hour is less, account for the crossing over of 12 noon or midnight.
3. **Count the Minutes**: Do the same for minutes. If the end minutes are less than the start minutes, borrow an hour, convert it to 60 minutes, and adjust accordingly.

#### Example Problem

An event starts at 3:45 PM and ends at 6:10 PM. Determine the elapsed time.

1. Start with the hours: From 3 to 6 is 3 hours.
2. Look at the minutes: Since 45 minutes must turn to 10 minutes, convert one hour (60 minutes). Thus, it becomes $60 - 45 = 15$. Now it's 25 minutes from 3:45 to 4:10.
3. Add the minutes from 4:10 to 6:10, which is 2 hours.
4. Total elapsed time is 2 hours and 25 minutes.

#### Real-World Application

- **Daily Schedules**: Planning activities like school, extra-curricular lessons, and playing involves managing and knowing the elapsed time.
- **Transportation**: Calculating travel time helps in arriving on time.

#### Practice Problems

1. Your class starts at 9:15 AM and ends at 10:45 AM. How long is your class?
2. You have a meeting from 1:30 PM to 3:00 PM. How much time does the meeting take?
3. If it takes 20 minutes to walk to school and you leave at 8:10 AM, when will you arrive?
4. A movie starts at 2:20 PM and finishes at 4:50 PM. What is the duration of the movie?
5. You begin your homework at 5:50 PM and finish at 7:05 PM. Determine the elapsed time spent on homework.
