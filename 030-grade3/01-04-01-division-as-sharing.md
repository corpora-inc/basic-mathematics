### Division as Sharing

Division is one of the four basic operations in arithmetic, alongside addition, subtraction, and multiplication. It is often described as the process of splitting a number into equal parts. A common way to understand division is to think of it as **sharing**. This method involves dividing a collection of items into equal groups.

**Example:**

Imagine you have 12 apples and you want to share them equally among 4 friends. How many apples would each friend get? To solve this, you are dividing 12 by 4, which gives you 3. Therefore, each friend receives 3 apples.

#### Understanding the Division Symbol

Division is typically represented by the symbol `รท` or the slash `/`. In expressions like `12 รท 4` or `12 / 4`, the number before the symbol is called the **dividend** (12 in this case), the number after is the **divisor** (4 here), and the result is the **quotient** (3 in this example).

#### Applications of Division as Sharing

Understanding division as sharing has practical applications in everyday life:

- **Food Sharing**: Dividing food equally among a group, like cutting a pizza into equal slices for everyone.
- **Budgeting**: Allocating equal amounts of money to different activities or savings.
- **Resource Distribution**: Ensuring that resources like books, toys, or materials are distributed equally.

#### Practice Problems

1. Share 20 candies equally among 5 children. How many candies does each child receive?
2. You have 18 balloons and want to divide them equally among 6 friends. How many balloons does each friend get?
3. There are 30 cookies, and you want to package them equally into 10 boxes. How many cookies will each box contain?
4. A farmer divides 25 apples equally into baskets that hold 5 apples each. How many baskets does the farmer need?
5. You have 40 markers and want to give them equally to 8 students. How many markers will each student receive?

By practicing division as sharing, you will gain a deeper understanding of how division works, both in mathematical problems and real-world scenarios.
