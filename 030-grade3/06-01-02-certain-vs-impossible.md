### Certain vs Impossible

Understanding the concepts of certainty and impossibility is crucial in the study of probability. These concepts describe the extreme ends of probabilityâ€”the likelihood of an event occurring.

#### Certain Events

A certain event is one that will definitely happen. The probability of a certain event is always 1. This means there is absolute assurance that the event will occur.

**Example:**
- If you have a jar full of red marbles, the probability of drawing a red marble from the jar is certain. In this scenario, the chance of picking a red marble is 100%, or a probability of 1.

#### Impossible Events

An impossible event is one that will not happen under any circumstances. The probability of an impossible event is 0, indicating that there is no chance of the event occurring.

**Example:**
- If you are rolling a standard six-sided die, the probability of rolling a 7 is impossible. Since a die only has numbers from 1 to 6, rolling a 7 cannot happen, so the probability is 0.

#### Real-World Applications

The concepts of certain and impossible events are used in various settings such as:

- **Safety Checks:** Companies use certain events to ensure that products meet safety standards. For example, a seatbelt must work under certain conditions to protect passengers.
- **Scientific Experiments:** Scientists often predict certain outcomes to test their hypotheses. Conversely, ruling out impossible events helps streamline experiments.

#### Practice Problems

1. Imagine you have a deck of cards without any aces. What is the probability of drawing an ace from this deck?
2. If a basket contains only oranges, what is the probability of randomly selecting an apple?
3. You have a fair six-sided die. What is the probability of rolling a number less than 7?
4. In a sealed bag containing 10 nuts, all are almonds. What is the probability of randomly picking an almond?
