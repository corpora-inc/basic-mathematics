### Milliliters and Liters

Understanding how to measure liquid volumes is an essential skill in daily life. In this lesson, we will explore the metric units for measuring liquid volume: **milliliters** and **liters**.

> **Definition**: A **litre** (L) is a unit of volume. A **milliliter** (mL) is one-thousandth of a liter, meaning there are 1,000 milliliters in a liter.

#### Uses and Importance

Milliliters and liters are widely used to measure liquid substances like water, juice, milk, and gasoline. Understanding these units helps in various everyday activities, such as cooking, measuring drinks, or refueling vehicles.

**Examples**:

- A standard bottle of water often contains 500 mL.
- A typical storage of gasoline in a small car is measured in liters, like 40 L.

#### Metric System Overview

The metric system is a decimal-based system of measurement used around the world. It's important to become familiar with this system as it is commonly used in science, medicine, and many international contexts.

- **Milliliter (mL):** Smaller amounts of liquid, often found in measuring cups or spoons.
- **Liter (L):** Larger quantities, used for bigger containers of liquid.

#### Conversion between Milliliters and Liters

Since 1 liter equals 1,000 milliliters, conversion between these two units involves multiplying or dividing by 1,000.

- **Converting Liters to Milliliters:** Multiply the number of liters by 1,000.
- **Converting Milliliters to Liters:** Divide the number of milliliters by 1,000.

**Example Conversion**:

1. Convert 3 liters to milliliters:
   - $3 \times 1,000 = 3,000$ mL

2. Convert 1,500 milliliters to liters:
   - $1,500 \div 1,000 = 1.5$ L

#### Practice Problems

1. A juice pack contains 250 mL of juice. How many liters is this?
2. A tank holds 5 liters of water. How many milliliters does it contain?
3. If you have 0.75 liters of milk, how many milliliters do you have?
4. Convert 2,500 milliliters to liters.
5. You fill a container with 0.2 liters of oil. Represent this volume in milliliters.

Understanding and using milliliters and liters effectively allows you to measure and manage liquid volumes efficiently in both everyday and scientific situations. Keep practicing these conversions to become more confident in metric measurements.
