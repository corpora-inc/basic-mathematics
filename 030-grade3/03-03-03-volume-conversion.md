### Volume Conversion

Understanding how to convert between different units of volume is essential for working accurately with liquids and gases in both everyday situations and scientific contexts. Volume conversion involves changing a measurement from one unit to another, which is crucial when using recipes, measuring liquids for experiments, or filling a swimming pool.

#### Common Volume Units

In the customary system, the units of volume you are likely to encounter include:
- **Cups**
- **Pints**
- **Quarts**
- **Gallons**

In the metric system, volume is often measured using:
- **Milliliters (mL)**
- **Liters (L)**

Understanding how these units relate to each other allows you to convert measurements accurately.

#### Volume Conversion in the Customary System

To convert between units in the customary system, use these basic conversions:
- **1 cup** = 8 ounces
- **1 pint** = 2 cups
- **1 quart** = 2 pints
- **1 gallon** = 4 quarts

**Example:** Convert 3 gallons to quarts.

To convert gallons to quarts, use the conversion: 1 gallon = 4 quarts.
Therefore, 
$$3 \text{ gallons} \times 4 \text{ quarts per gallon} = 12 \text{ quarts}$$

#### Volume Conversion in the Metric System

Metric conversions often involve moving the decimal point because units are based on powers of ten:
- **1 liter** = 1,000 milliliters

**Example:** Convert 2.5 liters to milliliters.

Since 1 liter = 1,000 milliliters, then
$$2.5 \text{ liters} \times 1,000 \text{ mL per liter} = 2,500 \text{ mL}$$

#### Practice Problems

1. Convert 4 quarts to cups.
2. How many liters are there in 3,500 milliliters?
3. If you have 16 cups, how many pints do you have?
4. Convert 5 gallons to pints.
5. Change 7,250 milliliters to liters.
