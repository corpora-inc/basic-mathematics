### Equivalent Fractions

Fractions represent parts of a whole. Sometimes, different fractions can express the same quantity. These are called equivalent fractions. In this lesson, we will explore what equivalent fractions are and how to find them.

#### What Are Equivalent Fractions?

Equivalent fractions are fractions that have different numerators and denominators but represent the same value. For example, $\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{2}{4}$ are equivalent fractions because both represent the same point on a number line.

Mathematically, two fractions $\frac{a}{b}$ and $\frac{c}{d}$ are considered equivalent if:

$$
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d} \quad \text{if and only if} \quad a \times d = b \times c
$$

This means that the cross-products of the fractions are equal.

#### Finding Equivalent Fractions

To find equivalent fractions, you can either multiply or divide the numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same non-zero number. This process maintains the value of the fraction.

**Example 1:**
Find fractions equivalent to $\frac{3}{5}$.

1. Multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 2:
   $$ \frac{3 \times 2}{5 \times 2} = \frac{6}{10} $$

2. Multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 3:
   $$ \frac{3 \times 3}{5 \times 3} = \frac{9}{15} $$

Thus, both $\frac{6}{10}$ and $\frac{9}{15}$ are equivalent to $\frac{3}{5}$.

**Example 2:**
Find fractions equivalent to $\frac{4}{6}$ by dividing.

1. Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:
   $$ \frac{4 \div 2}{6 \div 2} = \frac{2}{3} $$

Therefore, $\frac{2}{3}$ is equivalent to $\frac{4}{6}$.

#### Real-World Application

Equivalent fractions are useful in various real-world scenarios. For example, consider a recipe that requires $\frac{1}{2}$ cup of an ingredient. If you want to make the recipe for more people, you can scale the ingredients proportionally. Knowing $\frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4}$ helps in measuring with different cup sizes, making the process more flexible.

#### Practice Problems

1. Find two fractions equivalent to $\frac{5}{8}$.
2. Simplify the fraction $\frac{12}{16}$ and identify an equivalent fraction.
3. Determine if the fractions $\frac{6}{9}$ and $\frac{2}{3}$ are equivalent.
4. Write down three different fractions that are equivalent to $\frac{7}{14}$.
5. Solve: If $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{3}{9}$ and $a = 6$, what is the value of $b$?
