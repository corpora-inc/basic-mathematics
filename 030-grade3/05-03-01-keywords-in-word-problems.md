### Keywords in Word Problems

Understanding keywords in word problems is essential for translating everyday language into mathematical expressions. This skill allows students to identify the operations needed to solve problems correctly. In this lesson, you will learn how to recognize these keywords and apply them effectively.

#### Common Keywords for Operations

- **Addition**: Words often associated with addition include *sum*, *total*, *altogether*, *increase*, and *add*.
  - **Example**: *The total number of apples and oranges is 25*.

- **Subtraction**: Keywords related to subtraction include *difference*, *less*, *subtract*, *decrease*, and *remain*.
  - **Example**: *If you subtract 5 from 20, what is the remainder?*

- **Multiplication**: Words indicating multiplication include *product*, *times*, *of*, *double*, and *triple*.
  - **Example**: *Find the product of 4 and 7*.

- **Division**: Division is often signaled by words such as *quotient*, *per*, *divide*, *equal parts*, and *shared*.
  - **Example**: *Divide 30 by 5 to find equal parts*.

#### Using Keywords in Practice

Identifying these keywords helps in discerning the correct operation needed in a word problem. It is important to read through the entire problem and understand the context, as sometimes keywords can be misleading without a proper understanding of the problem's narrative.

**Example Problem:**

*Maria has 3 times as many marbles as Juan. If Juan has 4 marbles, how many marbles does Maria have?*

- **Keyword Analysis**: The word *times* suggests multiplication.
- **Mathematical Formulation**: Maria's marbles = 3 times Juan's marbles = $3 	imes 4$.
- **Solution**: Maria has 12 marbles.

#### Practice Problems

1. A farmer has 15 apples. He gives away some, leaving him with 10 apples. How many did he give away?
2. A pack of 24 crayons is shared equally among 6 students. How many crayons does each student receive?
3. If a car travels 60 miles per hour for 3 hours, how far does it travel in total?
4. Sarah has $5, and she buys 3 packs of stickers that cost $2 each. How much money does she have left?
5. A baker needs 5 times more flour than sugar for a recipe. If the sugar needed is 2 cups, how much flour is needed?
