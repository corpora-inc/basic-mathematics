### Two-Digit Subtraction

Two-digit subtraction is an essential arithmetic skill involving subtracting one two-digit number from another. This lesson will illuminate the process of subtracting numbers up to 99, including methods like regrouping or borrowing when necessary.

#### Understanding the Basics

To subtract two-digit numbers, each digit in the top number must be greater than or equal to the corresponding digit in the bottom number. If not, regrouping (also known as borrowing) is necessary.

Example of two-digit subtraction without regrouping:

$$
\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c}
  & 5 & 3 \\
- & 2 & 1 \\
\hline
  & 3 & 2 \\
\end{array}
$$

Example of two-digit subtraction with regrouping:

When subtracting a larger digit from a smaller digit, regrouping is necessary:

$$
\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c}
  & 7 & 4 \\
- & 2 & 9 \\
\hline
  & 4 & 5 \\
\end{array}
$$

1. **Tens place**: Subtract the tens digit (7 - 2 = 5).
2. **Ones place**: Regroup because 4 is less than 9. 
3. **Regrouping**:
   - Convert 1 ten to 10 ones.
   - Tens become 6 (7 - 1 = 6), and ones become 14 (4 + 10 = 14).
4. **Subtraction**: Subtract the ones digit after regrouping (14 - 9 = 5), resulting in 45.

#### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Place the numbers vertically**, aligning the tens and ones digits.
2. **Start with the ones digit**:
    - If the top digit is smaller, regroup.
    - Subtract the bottom from the top ones digit.
3. **Move to the tens digit**:
    - After regrouping, subtract the lower tens digit from the higher tens digit.
4. **Record the result.**

#### Practice Problems

Here are some practice problems:

1. Subtract:
   $$
   \begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c}
     & 8 & 9 \\
   - & 4 & 7 \\
   \hline
   \end{array}
   $$

2. Subtract:
   $$
   \begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c}
     & 7 & 3 \\
   - & 5 & 6 \\
   \hline
   \end{array}
   $$

3. Subtract:
   $$
   \begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c}
     & 5 & 8 \\
   - & 3 & 4 \\
   \hline
   \end{array}
   $$

4. Subtract:
   $$
   \begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c}
     & 9 & 4 \\
   - & 4 & 9 \\
   \hline
   \end{array}
   $$

5. Subtract:
   $$
   \begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c}
     & 7 & 7 \\
   - & 2 & 8 \\
   \hline
   \end{array}
   $$

6. Subtract:
   $$
   \begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c}
     & 6 & 5 \\
   - & 3 & 9 \\
   \hline
   \end{array}
   $$

7. Subtract:
   $$
   \begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c}
     & 5 & 3 \\
   - & 1 & 8 \\
   \hline
   \end{array}
   $$

8. Subtract:
   $$
   \begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c}
     & 8 & 0 \\
   - & 6 & 7 \\
   \hline
   \end{array}
   $$

#### Real-World Application

Two-digit subtraction is vital for everyday math problems, particularly in shopping and budgeting. For example, if you have $53 and spend $27, calculating the remaining money involves a two-digit subtraction: $$53 - 27 = 26$$. This calculation is essential in various real-world scenarios like managing expenses, understanding budgets, and determining changes in transactions.

#### Historical Context

The concept of subtraction dates back to ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians and Babylonians, who utilized basic arithmetic for trade management and resources distribution. Over time, subtraction, alongside other arithmetic operations, has become fundamental in scientific fields, contributing to technological advancements and practical applications.
