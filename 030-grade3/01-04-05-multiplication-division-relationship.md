### Multiplication and Division Relationship

#### Understanding the Connection

Multiplication and division are closely related operations. They are often referred to as inverse operations, meaning one operation can be used to undo the other. Understanding this relationship helps in solving problems and checking work for accuracy.

- **Multiplication**: Repeated addition, where a number is added to itself a specific number of times.
- **Division**: Splitting a number into equal parts or finding out how many times one number is contained within another.

For example, if you know that $3 \times 4 = 12$, you can determine that $12 \div 4 = 3$ because division is finding how many times 4 fits into 12.

#### Real-World Applications

This relationship is useful in various real-world settings:

- **Shopping**: If a group of items costs a certain total and you know the price of one item, you can find out how many items you have.
- **Cooking**: Recipes that need ingredients divided into certain portions can be adjusted using these operations.
- **Resource Allocation**: Dividing resources equally among groups efficiently involves both multiplication and division.

#### Practice Problems

1. If 5 boxes can each hold 8 toys, how many toys are there in total? Now, if you have 40 toys, how many toys will fit in each box if they are all used?
2. A gardener is planting seeds in rows. There are 6 seeds per row and 42 seeds total. How many full rows can the gardener plant?
3. A school orders 96 desks, and each classroom must have exactly 12 desks. How many classrooms can be fully equipped?
4. If $9 \times 7 = 63$, verify this multiplication by performing the division $63 \div 9$ and $63 \div 7$.
5. During a sale, socks are sold in packs of 3 pairs for each pack. If someone buys 24 pairs, how many packs did they purchase?
