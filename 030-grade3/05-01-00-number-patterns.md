## Number Patterns

Number patterns are fundamental in mathematics and can be found in both nature and everyday life. They help us recognize relationships and predict future events. In this section, we will explore various types of number patterns and how to identify them.

> **Definition:** A number pattern is a sequence of numbers that follows a particular rule or formula.

### Types of Number Patterns

#### 1. Arithmetic Patterns
An arithmetic pattern involves a sequence where each term is generated by adding or subtracting a constant. This constant is known as the common difference.

- **Example:** In the sequence 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., the common difference is 2. Each term is obtained by adding 2 to the previous term.
- **Real-world application:** Arithmetic patterns can be seen in calendars (e.g., increasing days of the week) and financial calculations like installment payments.

#### 2. Geometric Patterns
A geometric pattern involves a sequence where each term is generated by multiplying or dividing by a constant, known as the common ratio.

- **Example:** In the sequence 3, 9, 27, 81, ..., the common ratio is 3. Each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 3.
- **Real-world application:** Geometric sequences can describe exponential growth or decay, such as population growth or radioactive decay.

### Recognizing Patterns
To identify the rule of a pattern, observe the changes between consecutive terms. Note whether the change involves addition/subtraction (arithmetic) or multiplication/division (geometric).

### Practice Problems

1. Identify the next three numbers in the arithmetic sequence: 10, 15, 20, 25, ...
2. Find the common difference and the next number in the sequence: 7, 10, 13, 16, ...
3. Identify the next three numbers in the geometric sequence: 5, 10, 20, 40, ...
4. Determine the rule for this pattern and the next number: 1, 4, 9, 16, ...
5. Create your own number pattern where the first term is 2, and it follows a rule of your choice. Write the first five terms and explain the pattern rule used.
