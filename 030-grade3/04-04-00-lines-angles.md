## Lines and Angles

In the study of geometry, understanding lines and angles is fundamental. This subsection introduces the concepts of lines and angles, focusing on recognizing and differentiating between various types. These concepts form the basis for more advanced geometry, assisting in understanding shapes, designs, and structures both in mathematics and the real world.

**Key Concepts**

- **Lines**: Lines extend infinitely in both directions and are one-dimensional. They can be straight or curved. In practical terms, they are used to represent boundaries and direct paths. Understanding lines is essential for interpreting graphs and navigational paths.
  - **Line Segments**: Part of a line with two endpoints. Used in design and construction, representing fixed distances or paths.
  - **Rays**: Part of a line with one endpoint, extending infinitely in one direction. Seen in the representation of sunlight or travels paths like highways leading outwards from a city.
  - **Parallel Lines**: Lines in the same plane that never intersect. Important in the design of structures and roads.

- **Angles**: Formed by two rays with a common endpoint, called the vertex. Angles are fundamental in designing buildings, creating art, and understanding mechanical systems.
  - **Measuring Angles**: Angles are measured in degrees (°). A full circle is 360°.
  - **Real-world Applications**: Architecture (roof angles), art (creating perspective), and engineering.

By grasping these basics, students can advance to understanding complex geometric shapes and solving real-world problems that involve spatial reasoning. This foundation supports further learning in mathematical logic, measurements, and spatial design.
