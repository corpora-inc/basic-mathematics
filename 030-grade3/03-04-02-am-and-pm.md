### Understanding AM and PM

Understanding the difference between AM and PM is essential for telling time correctly. The 24-hour day is divided into two 12-hour cycles labeled as AM and PM, helping us specify when events occur in terms of half-day periods.

#### What Do AM and PM Mean?

- **AM (Ante Meridiem)**: This Latin term means "before midday." It refers to the hours from midnight (12:00 AM) to just before noon (11:59 AM).
- **PM (Post Meridiem)**: This term means "after midday." It covers the hours from noon (12:00 PM) to just before midnight (11:59 PM).

Knowing whether to use AM or PM is vital for setting accurate times for various activities. For example, school usually starts in the AM, while most bedtime routines occur in the PM.

#### Real-World Applications

Understanding AM and PM helps in many day-to-day activities and planning, including:

- Setting alarm clocks to the correct part of the day to wake up in the morning.
- Scheduling activities such as sports practice or music lessons.
- Understanding television schedules for shows or news segments.
- Planning meals of the day, such as breakfast in the AM and dinner in the PM.

#### Practice Problems

1. You have a doctor's appointment at 3:00 PM. How many hours after noon is your appointment?
2. If you wake up at 7:00 AM and go to bed at 9:00 PM, how many hours are you awake during the day?
3. School starts at 8:15 AM and ends at 3:00 PM. How many hours are you in school?
4. A breakfast meeting is scheduled for 9:30 AM. What part of the day does this take place in?
5. If a television show airs at 8:00 PM, what is another way to express this time using a 24-hour clock?
