### Cubes, Cylinders, and Cones

In this lesson, we will explore some common three-dimensional shapes: cubes, cylinders, and cones. These shapes are part of the solid shapes category, which means they have volume and occupy space. Understanding these shapes will help you recognize them in the real world and understand their properties.

#### Properties of Cubes

A cube is a solid shape with six identical square faces. It has the following properties:

- **Edges**: A cube has 12 edges.
- **Vertices**: A cube has 8 vertices.
- **Faces**: All 6 faces are congruent squares.

> **Real-World Example**: Dice and Rubik's cubes are examples of cubes.

#### Properties of Cylinders

A cylinder is a solid shape with two parallel circular faces connected by a curved surface. It has:

- **Edges**: Technically, it has 2 curved edges.
- **Vertices**: It has no vertices.
- **Faces**: It consists of 2 circular faces and 1 curved surface.

> **Real-World Example**: Soup cans and batteries are shaped like cylinders.

#### Properties of Cones

A cone is a solid shape that has a flat circular base and a pointed top called the apex. Its properties include:

- **Edges**: It has 1 curved edge.
- **Vertices**: A cone has 1 vertex (at the apex).
- **Faces**: It has 1 flat circular face and 1 curved surface.

> **Real-World Example**: Ice cream cones and traffic cones are common cone shapes.

#### Practice Problems

1. **Identify the Shape**: Look around your house and list 5 items that resemble cubes, cylinders, or cones.

2. **Count the Faces and Edges**: Draw a cube, cylinder, and cone, and count the number of faces and edges each shape has.

3. **Volume and Surface Area Exploration**: Research how to calculate the volume and surface area for one of these shapes and explain to someone in your family.

4. **Shape Building**: Use modeling clay or building blocks to create a model of each shape discussed. Describe any challenges you faced in creating each model.
