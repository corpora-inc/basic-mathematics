### Inches and Feet

Inches and feet are units of length used to measure objects and distances. These units are part of the Imperial system, commonly used in the United States.

#### Understanding Inches and Feet

- **Inch**: An inch is a small unit of length, often used for measuring smaller objects like a pencil or the width of a book. It is abbreviated as "in."
- **Foot**: A foot is larger than an inch and is used to measure longer objects, such as the height of a person or the length of a room. It is abbreviated as "ft." There are 12 inches in one foot.

#### Conversion Between Inches and Feet

To convert inches to feet, divide the number of inches by 12. To convert feet to inches, multiply the number of feet by 12.

$$
5 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches per foot} = 60 \text{ inches}
$$
