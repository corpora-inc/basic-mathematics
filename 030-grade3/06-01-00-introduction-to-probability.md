## Introduction to Probability

Probability is the study of how likely an event is to occur. It helps us understand and quantify uncertainty in various situations. In everyday life, we often face events that are uncertain, and probability gives us the tools to reason about them logically and make informed decisions.

**Key Concepts in Probability**

- **Probability as a Measure of Likelihood**: Probability is expressed as a number between 0 and 1. A probability of 0 indicates an impossible event, while a probability of 1 indicates a certain event. All other probabilities fall between these two extremes and indicate varying levels of likelihood.

- **Applications of Probability**: Understanding probability is useful in many fields, such as weather forecasting, sports, and medicine. For example, meteorologists use probability to predict the chance of rain, while doctors might use it to evaluate the risk of certain conditions.

- **Basic Probability Terms**:
  - **Experiment**: An action with an uncertain result, such as flipping a coin.
  - **Outcome**: A possible result of an experiment, like getting heads in a coin flip.
  - **Event**: A collection of one or more outcomes. For instance, rolling a number greater than four on a die.

Probability is foundational for understanding randomness and making predictions based on incomplete information. As you explore this subsection, you will learn to apply these concepts through engaging examples and tasks.
