### Mixed Word Problems

Mixed word problems are a vital component of mathematical learning, allowing students to apply various concepts and operations in practical situations. These exercises integrate addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to build problem-solving skills.

#### Understanding the Problem

To effectively solve mixed word problems, it is essential to:

- **Carefully read the problem**: Pay attention to details and what the question is asking.
- **Identify keywords**: Look for terms that indicate specific mathematical operations, such as "total" for addition, "difference" for subtraction, "product" for multiplication, and "quotient" for division.
- **Determine the necessary operations**: Decide which operations will be needed to find the solution.
- **Plan a strategy**: Think about the steps required to reach the answer.

#### Example

*Problem: A farmer has 50 apples. He sells 18 apples and then buys 30 more. How many apples does he have now?*

1. **Identify operations:** Start with subtraction (sell apples), followed by addition (buy more apples).
2. **Calculate:**
   - 50 apples - 18 apples = 32 apples (after selling)
   - 32 apples + 30 apples = 62 apples (after buying)
3. **Conclusion:** The farmer has 62 apples now.

#### Practice Problems

1. Sarah has 45 candies. She gives 15 to her friends and later receives 10 more from her brother. How many candies does she have now?
2. A shopkeeper has 120 bottles. He sells 43 bottles in the morning and 25 in the evening. How many bottles are left?
3. A school orders 200 chairs for a new auditorium. They receive 175 chairs in the first delivery. How many chairs are still needed?
4. John has $60. He spends $22 on a book and $18 on lunch. How much money does he have left?
5. A gardener plants 85 seeds. Some seeds donâ€™t sprout, and only 67 plants are grown successfully. How many seeds did not sprout?

These exercises help develop critical thinking and mathematical reasoning, preparing students for more complex mathematical challenges in the future.
