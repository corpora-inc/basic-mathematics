### Adding and Subtracting Fractions with Like Denominators

When we add or subtract fractions with like denominators, the denominators remain the same throughout the operation. Since the denominators are identical, we only need to focus on the numerators.

#### Key Concepts

- **Like Denominators**: Fractions that have the same denominator. For example, in the fractions $\frac{3}{8}$ and $\frac{5}{8}$, the denominator 8 is the same.
- **Adding Fractions**: When adding fractions with like denominators, you add the numerators and keep the denominator the same.
- **Subtracting Fractions**: When subtracting fractions with like denominators, you subtract the numerators and keep the denominator the same.

> **Example**: Adding Fractions
>
> Consider the fractions $\frac{2}{7}$ and $\frac{3}{7}$. To add these fractions:
>
> 1. Add the numerators: $2 + 3 = 5$.
> 2. Keep the denominator: 7.
>
> Therefore, $\frac{2}{7} + \frac{3}{7} = \frac{5}{7}$.

> **Example**: Subtracting Fractions
>
> Consider the fractions $\frac{5}{9}$ and $\frac{2}{9}$. To subtract these fractions:
>
> 1. Subtract the numerators: $5 - 2 = 3$.
> 2. Keep the denominator: 9.
>
> Therefore, $\frac{5}{9} - \frac{2}{9} = \frac{3}{9}$, which simplifies to $\frac{1}{3}$.

#### Real-World Application

Adding and subtracting fractions with like denominators appear in numerous real-world contexts. For example, when combining measurements that are in the same unit (such as cups in a recipe), or when adjusting time that is consistently broken into equal segments.

#### Practice Problems

1. Add the fractions $\frac{4}{10}$ and $\frac{3}{10}$. What is the result?
2. Subtract the fraction $\frac{1}{4}$ from $\frac{3}{4}$. Simplify your answer, if possible.
3. Combine $\frac{7}{12}$ and $\frac{2}{12}$.
4. If a pizza is cut into 8 equal slices and you eat 3 slices, what fraction of the pizza do you have left?
5. Subtract $\frac{5}{6}$ from $\frac{8}{6}$ and simplify the result.

These practice problems will help you understand the process of adding and subtracting fractions with like denominators, paving the way for further exploration of fractional calculations.
