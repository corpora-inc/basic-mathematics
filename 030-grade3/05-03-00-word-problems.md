## Word Problems

Word problems are mathematical exercises where students solve problems using a written description. These tasks require the integration of reading and mathematical skills to extract and apply the necessary information for a solution. Word problems help students develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

### Importance of Word Problems

Word problems provide a practical context for mathematical theories, helping students understand how these concepts apply in real-life situations. By translating everyday scenarios into mathematical questions, students learn to:

- Identify relevant information.
- Determine which mathematical operations to use.
- Construct equations from verbal descriptions.
- Verify the correctness of their solutions.

### Strategies for Solving Word Problems

1. **Read the Problem Carefully**: Understanding the problem is crucial. Read it multiple times if necessary.
2. **Identify Key Information**: Determine what information is necessary to solve the problem and what can be ignored.
3. **Decide on Operations**: Consider which mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to use.
4. **Translate to Equations**: Convert the words into mathematical expressions or equations.
5. **Solve the Problem**: Perform the necessary calculations to find the solution.
6. **Check the Solution**: Review the problem and the solution to ensure accuracy.

### Examples

1. **Simple Addition and Subtraction**
   - **Problem**: Sarah has 12 apples. She gives 4 apples to her friend. How many apples does she have now?
   - **Solution**: $12 - 4 = 8$. Sarah has 8 apples remaining.

2. **Multiplication**
   - **Problem**: A box contains 5 rows of chocolates with 6 chocolates in each row. How many chocolates are there in total?
   - **Solution**: $5 \times 6 = 30$. There are 30 chocolates in the box.

3. **Division**
   - **Problem**: There are 24 students in a class. The teacher wants to divide them into 4 equal groups. How many students will be in each group?
   - **Solution**: $24 \div 4 = 6$. Each group will have 6 students.

### Practice Problems

1. Maria has 18 marbles. She buys 7 more from a store. How many marbles does she have in total?
2. Tom spent $45 on 3 books. If each book costs the same amount, how much did each book cost?
3. A gardener has planted 36 flowers in 3 equal rows. How many flowers are there in each row?
4. A bakery sold 56 loaves of bread in 7 days. On average, how many loaves were sold per day?
