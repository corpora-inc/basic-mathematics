## Adding and Subtracting Fractions

Understanding how to add and subtract fractions is an important skill in mathematics. This lesson will focus on the fundamental methods for performing these operations with fractions. Let's explore these concepts in detail.

**Key Concepts**

- **Fractions** represent parts of a whole. They consist of a numerator (top part) and a denominator (bottom part).
- **Like denominators** mean that the denominators of the fractions involved are the same.
- For addition and subtraction of fractions, having like denominators simplifies the process.

**Adding Fractions with Like Denominators**

To add fractions with like denominators:

1. **Add the numerators**: Keep the same denominator and add the numerators.
2. **Simplify** if necessary: If the resulting fraction can be simplified, do so.

**Example**:

Add $\frac{3}{8}$ and $\frac{4}{8}$:

$$
\frac{3}{8} + \frac{4}{8} = \frac{3 + 4}{8} = \frac{7}{8}
$$

**Subtracting Fractions with Like Denominators**

To subtract fractions with like denominators:

1. **Subtract the numerators**: Keep the same denominator and subtract the numerators.
2. **Simplify** if needed: If the resulting fraction can be simplified, do so.

**Example**:

Subtract $\frac{5}{6}$ from $\frac{7}{6}$:

$$
\frac{7}{6} - \frac{5}{6} = \frac{7 - 5}{6} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
$$

**Real-World Application**

Fractions are frequently used in daily-life scenarios, such as cooking. For instance, if a recipe requires $\frac{1}{2}$ cup of sugar and $\frac{1}{4}$ cup more, you will need to add these fractions. Similarly, understanding how to subtract fractions can be useful in tasks such as determining remaining ingredients or fuel.
