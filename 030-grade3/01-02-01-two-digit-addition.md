### Two-Digit Addition

Adding two-digit numbers is a fundamental skill in mathematics that builds on your understanding of place value. When you add two-digit numbers, it is important to keep the digits properly aligned according to their place values: tens and ones. Below are the steps to add two-digit numbers, followed by practice problems to reinforce the concept.

#### Steps for Adding Two-Digit Numbers

1. **Align the Numbers**: Write the two numbers in a column, ensuring that the tens and ones digits are aligned.
2. **Add the Ones**: Begin by adding the digits in the ones column. If the sum is 10 or more, carry over the extra value to the tens column.
3. **Add the Tens**: Next, add the digits in the tens column. If you carried over a value from the ones column, make sure to include it in this sum.
4. **Combine the Results**: The final step is to combine the sums of the tens and ones columns to get the total sum.

#### Example

Let's add 47 and 38 step by step:

- **Align the Numbers**: 

  $$
  \begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c}
    & 4 & 7 \\
  + & 3 & 8 \\
  \hline
  \end{array}
  $$

- **Add the Ones**:
  
  $$7 + 8 = 15$$

  Write 5 under the ones column and carry over 1 to the tens column.

- **Add the Tens**:
  
  $$4 + 3 = 7$$

  Include the carried-over 1: $$7 + 1 = 8$$

- **Combine the Results**:

  Write 8 under the tens column. Thus, the result is 85.

  $$
  \begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c}
    & 4 & 7 \\
  + & 3 & 8 \\
  \hline
    & 8 & 5 \\
  \end{array}
  $$

#### Practice Problems

1. Calculate:

   $$54 + 27$$

2. Calculate:

   $$68 + 33$$

3. Calculate:

   $$79 + 18$$

4. Calculate:

   $$45 + 56$$

5. Calculate:

   $$32 + 67$$

6. Calculate:

   $$21 + 89$$

7. Calculate:

   $$95 + 14$$

8. Calculate:

   $$61 + 37$$

9. Calculate:

   $$83 + 28$$

10. Calculate:

    $$47 + 54$$

By practicing these problems, you will strengthen your ability to perform two-digit addition with confidence and accuracy. Remember to follow each step carefully and double-check your work for any possible errors.
