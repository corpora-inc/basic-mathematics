### Even and Odd Numbers

Even and odd numbers are fundamental concepts in mathematics that help us understand number properties and patterns.

> **Even Numbers** are integers that can be divided evenly by 2. This means there is no remainder when the number is divided by 2. Some examples include 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.

> **Odd Numbers** are integers that cannot be divided evenly by 2. When an odd number is divided by 2, it leaves a remainder of 1. Some examples are 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9.

#### Identifying Even and Odd Numbers
- **Method 1**: Look at the last digit of the number.
  - If the last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, then the number is even.
  - If the last digit is 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9, then the number is odd.

- **Method 2**: Use division.
  - Perform the division by 2.
  - If the number divides without leaving a remainder, it's even.
  - If there is a remainder, it's odd.

#### Application in the Real World
Even and odd numbers are not just for math problems; they appear in everyday life:
- **Sports Teams**: Organizing players into equal teams may depend on whether the number is even or odd.
- **Patterns**: Understanding these numbers helps in identifying patterns, such as in seating arrangements or street numbers.

#### Examples
1. Determine if the following numbers are even or odd:
   - 23
   - 44
   - 56
   - 79

2. List the first five odd numbers starting from 10.

3. Explain why 102 is an even number.

#### Practice Problems
1. A group has 35 students: Identify if the number of students is even or odd.
2. When counting by twos from 1 to 20, how many odd numbers do you encounter?
3. Find out whether the sum of 50 and 31 is even or odd.
4. Create your own list of ten numbers: identify which are even and which are odd.
5. Determine if the result of multiplying two odd numbers (e.g., 3 and 5) is even or odd and explain why. 

These exercises will help solidify the understanding of even and odd numbers in various contexts.
