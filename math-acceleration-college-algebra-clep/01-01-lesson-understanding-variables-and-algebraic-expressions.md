## Understanding Variables and Algebraic Expressions

This lesson explains what variables and algebraic expressions are and how they are used to represent unknown values and operations. We will define key terms, demonstrate multiple methods for working with expressions, and provide real-world, step-by-step examples.

### What Are Variables?

A variable is a symbol, usually a letter, that stands for an unknown or changeable number. For example, in the expression

$$
x + 5
$$

the letter $x$ is a variable. It can represent any number.

### What Are Algebraic Expressions?

An algebraic expression combines numbers, variables, and arithmetic operations (such as $+$, $-$, $\times$, $\div$). For instance:

$$
3x + 2
$$

Here, $3x$ means $3$ multiplied by $x$. The expression represents a relationship between $x$ and a constant number 2.

> Remember: Variables allow flexibility, and expressions help us model real-life problems.

### Components of Algebraic Expressions

1. **Coefficients:** Numbers that multiply the variables. In $3x$, $3$ is the coefficient.
2. **Constants:** Fixed numbers that do not change. In $3x + 2$, $2$ is a constant.
3. **Terms:** Sub-expressions separated by $+$ or $-$ signs. In $3x + 2$, there are two terms: $3x$ and $2$.

### Step-by-Step Example: Evaluating an Expression

Suppose we have the expression

$$
2x + 7
$$

and we know that $x = 3$. We can evaluate the expression by substituting $x$ with $3$:

1. Substitute:
   $$
   2(3) + 7
   $$

2. Multiply:
   $$
   6 + 7
   $$

3. Add:
   $$
   13
   $$

So, when $x = 3$, the expression $2x + 7$ equals $13$.

### Combining Like Terms

Like terms are terms that contain the same variable raised to the same power. For example, in the expression

$$
4x + 5 + 3x - 2
$$

we can combine $4x$ and $3x$ (both containing $x$):

$$
4x + 3x = 7x
$$

Then, combine the constants $5 - 2 = 3$, to get the simplified expression:

$$
7x + 3
$$

### Real-World Application: Business Revenue

Imagine a small business that sells handmade notebooks. Let $n$ represent the number of notebooks sold. If each notebook is sold for $5, and there is a fixed shipping fee of $10 per order, the revenue $R$ can be modeled as:

$$
R = 5n + 10
$$

This expression allows the business to quickly calculate revenue for any number of notebooks sold.

### Additional Example: Engineering and Material Costs

Suppose an engineer is designing a beam that requires a certain amount of material. Let $m$ represent the meters of material needed per unit length of the beam. If the cost per unit is $8 and a fixed setup fee of $20 is charged, the total cost $C$ can be modeled as:

$$
C = 8m + 20
$$

This expression helps determine the cost when $m$ is known.

### Summary of Steps

- Identify variables in the expression.
- Recognize the coefficients, variables, and constants.
- Substitute known values to evaluate the expression.
- Combine like terms for simplification.

By understanding variables and algebraic expressions, you can translate real-world situations into mathematical models in areas such as finance, engineering, and sciences.
