## Solving Systems of Linear Equations by Elimination

The elimination method is used to solve a system of linear equations by removing one variable. This method relies on adding or subtracting equations after aligning the coefficients. Below, we outline the steps and provide detailed examples.

### Steps of the Elimination Method

1. Write the system of equations in standard form. Usually this means each equation should have the variables aligned:

$$
ax + by = c
$$

2. Multiply one or both equations by a number so that the coefficients of one variable become opposites.

3. Add or subtract the equations to eliminate that variable.

4. Solve the remaining equation for the single variable.

5. Substitute the found value into one of the original equations and solve for the other variable.

### Example 1: A Simple Case

Consider the system:

$$
2x + 3y = 12
$$

$$
4x - 3y = 6
$$

**Step 1:** Notice the coefficients of $y$ are $3$ and $-3$. They cancel when added.

**Step 2:** Add the two equations:

$$
(2x + 3y) + (4x - 3y) = 12 + 6
$$

This gives:

$$
6x = 18
$$

**Step 3:** Divide by $6$:

$$
x = 3
$$

**Step 4:** Substitute $x = 3$ into the first equation:

$$
2(3) + 3y = 12
$$

$$
6 + 3y = 12
$$

Subtract $6$ from both sides:

$$
3y = 6
$$

Divide by $3$:

$$
y = 2
$$

So the solution is $x = 3$ and $y = 2$.

### Example 2: Elimination with Multiplication

Consider the system:

$$
3x + 4y = 10
$$

$$
5x - 2y = 8
$$

**Step 1:** In order to eliminate $y$, make the coefficients opposites. Multiply the second equation by $2$ to change $-2y$ to $-4y$:

$$
2(5x - 2y) = 2(8)
$$

This gives:

$$
10x - 4y = 16
$$

**Step 2:** Now add this new equation to the first equation:

$$
(3x + 4y) + (10x - 4y) = 10 + 16
$$

The $y$ terms cancel:

$$
13x = 26
$$

**Step 3:** Divide by $13$:

$$
x = 2
$$

**Step 4:** Substitute $x = 2$ into the first original equation:

$$
3(2) + 4y = 10
$$

$$
6 + 4y = 10
$$

Subtract $6$:

$$
4y = 4
$$

Divide by $4$:

$$
y = 1
$$

Thus, the solution is $x = 2$ and $y = 1$.

### Real-World Application: Financial Planning

Suppose you are planning a simple budget with two types of expenses. One expense costs $a$ dollars per unit and the other $b$ dollars per unit. If spending a total of $S_1$ dollars results in the equation:

$$
a_1x + b_1y = S_1,
$$

and a second scenario gives:

$$
a_2x + b_2y = S_2,
$$

you can use the elimination method to determine the number of units (represented by $x$ and $y$) needed in each category. The steps are the same: adjust the equations, eliminate one variable, and solve for both. This method can assist in balancing expenses when planning events or managing budgets.

### Key Concept

> The elimination method simplifies systems by strategically removing variables, making the solution straightforward.

Use this method anytime the coefficients of one variable can easily be manipulated to be opposites. Employing elimination often provides a clear and direct path to the solution.

Practice these steps with different systems of equations until the process becomes intuitive. Each system may require unique multiplication factors based on the coefficients provided.
