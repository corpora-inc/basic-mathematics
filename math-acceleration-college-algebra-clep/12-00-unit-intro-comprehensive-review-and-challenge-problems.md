# Comprehensive Review and Challenge Problems

This unit brings together all the algebra concepts you have mastered throughout the course. It is designed to review key topics and provide challenge problems that offer an opportunity to apply your skills in complex, real-world scenarios.

What: This unit covers a broad range of algebraic topics, including solving equations, working with functions, graphing, and transforming expressions. You will revisit fundamental ideas while facing advanced problems that require a synthesis of multiple skills.

Why: Comprehensive review and challenge problems are essential for reinforcing understanding and ensuring that you are fully prepared for the College Algebra CLEP exam. These exercises help identify areas where you can improve, and they encourage critical thinking by blending various concepts into one cohesive set of tasks.

How: The challenges presented in this unit replicate real-life applications, such as financial modeling, engineering design, and statistical analysis. By working through these problems, you will learn to strategically plan your approach and methodically solve complex problems.
