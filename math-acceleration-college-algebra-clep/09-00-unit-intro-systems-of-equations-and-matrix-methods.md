# Systems of Equations and Matrix Methods

This unit introduces systems of equations and the matrix methods used to solve them. The unit covers:

- What systems of linear equations are and how they can be represented.
- Methods for solving systems, including substitution, elimination, and matrix operations.
- The use of matrices, determinants, and inverse matrices in solving complex systems.

Understanding these concepts is important because systems of equations appear frequently in real-world scenarios. Fields such as engineering, economics, and computer science use these methods to model relationships and solve problems involving multiple variables. Learning these methods equips you with a toolkit for analytical reasoning and problem-solving in varied applications.

In this unit, you will learn how to translate real-world problems into systems of equations and apply systematic approaches to find solutions. The matrix methods section will provide a structured way to handle larger sets of equations efficiently.
