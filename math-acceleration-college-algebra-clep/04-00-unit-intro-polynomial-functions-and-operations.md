# Polynomial Functions and Operations

This unit introduces polynomial functions and the operations associated with them. In this unit, you will learn what polynomial functions are, why they are crucial in understanding algebraic relationships, and how to perform operations with them.

Polynomials are expressions that consist of variables raised to nonnegative integer exponents, combined using addition, subtraction, and multiplication. They serve as the foundation for many algebraic concepts and are essential for modeling real-world situations, including financial calculations, engineering designs, and even sports analytics.

Understanding the structure of polynomial functions will help you simplify complex expressions, perform calculations efficiently, and solve polynomial equations. This unit will provide you with the tools to add, subtract, multiply, and eventually divide polynomials. The techniques learned here are integral to further studies in algebra and its applications.
