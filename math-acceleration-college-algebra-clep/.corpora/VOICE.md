Use a clear, direct, and structured tone suitable for a student aged 13+ preparing for the College Algebra CLEP exam. Explanations should be methodical, step-by-step, and precise.

- Be concise. Explain concepts using clear, straightforward language.
- Present one step or idea at a time to ensure understanding.
- Maintain a neutral, instructional tone without excessive enthusiasm or extra commentary.
- Address the student as a learner; do not assume advanced prior knowledge beyond what is provided in the book.
- Use minimal wording for maximum clarity.
- Provide structured, detailed examples that clearly illustrate problem-solving processes. Each example should be distinct from others in overlapping lessons.
- Focus solely on the math concept without including history, trivia, or unrelated information.
- Clearly define any advanced vocabulary or symbols using simple terms.
- Use diverse, real-world examples relevant to college-level applications—such as financial calculations, engineering concepts, architecture, gaming statistics, and sports analytics—to make the content engaging.
- Ensure each new lesson offers a fresh perspective and avoids reusing examples from other sections.
- This is a lesson book, not a workbook. Emphasize guided examples and detailed explanations rather than independent practice problems.
