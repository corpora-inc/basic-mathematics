# Rational and Radical Functions

This unit introduces rational and radical functions, focusing on their definitions, key properties, and applications. In studying these functions, you will learn to determine domains, identify asymptotes in rational functions, and simplify and graph radical functions. These topics are essential for analyzing behaviors of functions, which are critical in various real-world applications.

Understanding rational functions involves examining expressions that are ratios of two polynomials. You will learn to recognize when these functions have restrictions due to division by zero and how to interpret asymptotic behavior as the input grows large or approaches a point of undefined behavior.

Radical functions, on the other hand, include expressions with roots. Mastering these functions will help you understand operations with radicals, determine valid input values based on even or odd roots, and graph the resulting curves. This understanding is foundational for solving practical problems in science, engineering, and finance.

These concepts matter because they bridge abstract mathematics and real-world modeling. Whether you are calculating rates in physics, optimizing design parameters in engineering, or analyzing trends in economics, a clear grasp of rational and radical functions is indispensable.

> Rational functions reveal the elegant balance between finite divisions and infinite limits, while radical functions unearth the hidden roots of complexity, together crafting a story of balance and transformation in mathematics.
