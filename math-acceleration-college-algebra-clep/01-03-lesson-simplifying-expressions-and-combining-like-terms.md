## Simplifying Expressions and Combining Like Terms

This lesson explains how to simplify algebraic expressions by combining like terms. Combining like terms reduces an expression to its simplest form. This is a fundamental skill in algebra used to solve equations, simplify expressions, and model real-world problems.

### Understanding Like Terms

> Like terms are terms that contain the same variable(s) raised to the same power. Only the coefficients (the numbers in front) may be different.

For example, in the expression $$3x + 5x$$ both terms are like terms because they each contain the variable $$x$$ raised to the first power. When the terms are combined, the result is $$8x$$.

### Step-by-Step Process for Simplification

1. **Identify Like Terms:** Look for terms with the same variable part. Constants (numbers without variables) are also like terms with other constants.

2. **Group Like Terms:** Write like terms together. For example, consider the expression:

$$
5a + 3b - 2a + 7 - 4b
$$

Group the terms as follows:

$$
(5a - 2a) + (3b - 4b) + 7
$$

3. **Combine the Coefficients:** Add or subtract the coefficients of the like terms:

$$
5a - 2a = 3a
$$
$$
3b - 4b = -b
$$

So the simplified expression becomes:

$$
3a - b + 7
$$

### Example 1: Simplify a Basic Expression

Simplify the expression:

$$
3x + 2x - 4
$$

**Solution:**

1. Identify like terms: $$3x$$ and $$2x$$ are like terms, and $$-4$$ is a constant.
2. Combine the like terms:

$$
3x + 2x = 5x
$$

3. Write the simplified form:

$$
5x - 4
$$

### Example 2: Expression with Multiple Variables and Parentheses

Simplify the expression:

$$
2(3x + 4) - 5x + (6 - x)
$$

**Step 1: Remove Parentheses**

Use the distributive property to expand the expression:

$$
2 \cdot 3x + 2 \cdot 4 - 5x + 6 - x
$$

This gives:

$$
6x + 8 - 5x + 6 - x
$$

**Step 2: Identify and Group Like Terms**

Group the $$x$$ terms and the constants:

$$
(6x - 5x - x) + (8 + 6)
$$

**Step 3: Combine Like Terms**

Combine the coefficients of $$x$$:

$$
6x - 5x - x = 0x
$$

And combine the constants:

$$
8 + 6 = 14
$$

The simplified expression is:

$$
0x + 14 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad 14
$$

### Real-World Application

In budgeting or financial calculations, expressions often need simplifying to consolidate like expenses or incomes, making the equation easier to interpret and solve. For instance, if $$3x$$ represents three months of an expense and $$2x$$ represents two months of the same expense, combining these helps calculate a total expense for five months.

By mastering the process of simplifying expressions and combining like terms, you deepen your algebra skills, paving the way for solving equations more effectively.
