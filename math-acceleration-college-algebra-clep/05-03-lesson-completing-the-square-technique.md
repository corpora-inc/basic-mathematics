## Completing the Square Technique

Completing the square is a method for solving quadratic equations and rewriting them in a form that reveals useful properties such as the vertex of the parabola. In this lesson, we explain the steps of the method, provide detailed examples, and illustrate the real-world usefulness of the process.

### Key Idea

A quadratic equation is generally written as

$$
a x^2 + b x + c = 0
$$

The goal is to transform the quadratic into a perfect square trinomial. When this is achieved, the equation can be rewritten as

$$
(ax + d)^2 = e
$$

This form makes further steps such as solving for $x$ or analyzing the graph of the quadratic easier.

### Steps for Completing the Square

1. **Normalize the quadratic term:** If $a \neq 1$, divide the entire equation by $a$ so that the quadratic coefficient becomes 1.

2. **Isolate the constant:** Rewrite the equation to separate the $x$ terms from the constant term. For example, rewrite

$$
x^2 + bx = -c
$$

3. **Determine the correction term:** Calculate half of the coefficient of $x$, then square it. This is given by

$$
\left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2
$$

4. **Add and subtract the correction term:** Add and subtract this term on the left side, grouping the perfect square trinomial together.

5. **Rewrite as a perfect square:** Express the left side as the square of a binomial. Then solve the resulting equation by taking square roots.

### Example 1: Solve $$x^2 + 6x + 5 = 0$$

Start with the equation:

$$
x^2 + 6x + 5 = 0
$$

**Step 1:** Move the constant term to the right side:

$$
x^2 + 6x = -5
$$

**Step 2:** Compute half of the coefficient of $x$: $\frac{6}{2} = 3$, and square it: $3^2 = 9$.

**Step 3:** Add $9$ to both sides to complete the square:

$$
x^2 + 6x + 9 = -5 + 9
$$

Simplify:

$$
x^2 + 6x + 9 = 4
$$

**Step 4:** Write the left side as a perfect square:

$$
(x + 3)^2 = 4
$$

**Step 5:** Solve by taking the square root of both sides:

$$
x + 3 = \pm 2
$$

This yields two solutions:

$$
x = -3 + 2 = -1
$$

and

$$
x = -3 - 2 = -5
$$

### Example 2: Solve $$2x^2 + 8x + 6 = 0$$

**Step 1:** Divide the entire equation by $2$ to simplify:

$$
x^2 + 4x + 3 = 0
$$

**Step 2:** Isolate the $x$ terms:

$$
x^2 + 4x = -3
$$

**Step 3:** Take half of $4$, which is $2$, and square it to get $4$.

**Step 4:** Add $4$ to both sides:

$$
x^2 + 4x + 4 = -3 + 4
$$

Simplify:

$$
x^2 + 4x + 4 = 1
$$

**Step 5:** Write the left side as a square:

$$
(x + 2)^2 = 1
$$

**Step 6:** Solve by taking the square root:

$$
x + 2 = \pm 1
$$

Thus, the solutions are:

$$
x = -2 + 1 = -1
$$

and

$$
x = -2 - 1 = -3
$$

### Real-World Application

Completing the square is not only a technique for finding the roots of quadratic equations. It also helps in rewriting quadratic functions into vertex form, which is important when analyzing the maximum or minimum values in financial calculations, engineering designs, and physics problems. For instance, determining the optimal profit or cost often requires identifying the vertex of a parabola, which is clearly seen when the quadratic function is expressed as a perfect square.

> Completing the square transforms a quadratic into a form that directly reveals its vertex, and thus provides insights into the functionâ€™s behavior.

By mastering this method, learners can solve quadratic equations effectively and understand the underlying structure of quadratic functions.
