## Solving Linear Equations with a Single Variable

Linear equations with a single variable are equations where the highest power of the variable is 1. The goal is to find the value of the variable that makes the equation true. In these equations, terms are added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided but the variable is never raised to a power other than 1.

### Basic Concepts

A linear equation in one variable typically looks like:

$$
a x + b = c
$$

where:

- $a$ is the coefficient (a number multiplied by the variable),
- $b$ is a constant (a fixed number), and
- $c$ is the result.

The process of solving these equations is about isolating the variable on one side of the equation using inverse operations.

> The process of solving an equation is like balancing a scale. Whatever you do to one side, you must do to the other.

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Simplify each side if necessary.**
   - Combine like terms and remove any grouping symbols.

2. **Remove constant terms from the side with the variable.**
   - Use addition or subtraction to move the constant term to the opposite side.

3. **Isolate the variable.**
   - Use multiplication or division to solve for the variable.

4. **Check the solution.**
   - Substitute the solution back into the original equation to verify it satisfies the equation.

### Example 1: Solving 3x + 5 = 20

We start with:

$$
3x + 5 = 20
$$

**Step 1: Subtract 5 from both sides.**

$$
3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
$$

$$
3x = 15
$$

**Step 2: Divide both sides by 3.**

$$
\frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
$$

$$
x = 5
$$

**Check:**

Substitute $x = 5$ back into the original equation:

$$
3(5) + 5 = 15 + 5 = 20
$$

Since both sides are equal, the solution $x = 5$ is verified.

### Example 2: Solving -4x + 2 = 10

Start with the equation:

$$
-4x + 2 = 10
$$

**Step 1: Subtract 2 from both sides.**

$$
-4x + 2 - 2 = 10 - 2
$$

$$
-4x = 8
$$

**Step 2: Divide both sides by -4.**

$$
\frac{-4x}{-4} = \frac{8}{-4}
$$

$$
x = -2
$$

**Check:**

Substitute $x = -2$:

$$
-4(-2) + 2 = 8 + 2 = 10
$$

The equation balances, so the solution is correct.

### Real-World Application Example

Imagine you are buying concert tickets which cost a fixed price per ticket. Suppose you know that if you buy a certain number of tickets, plus a fixed booking fee, the total cost is given by the equation:

$$
20x + 15 = 95
$$

Here, $20$ is the cost per ticket, $x$ is the number of tickets, and $15$ is the booking fee. To find the number of tickets purchased:

**Step 1: Subtract 15 from both sides.**

$$
20x = 95 - 15
$$

$$
20x = 80
$$

**Step 2: Divide both sides by 20.**

$$
x = \frac{80}{20}
$$

$$
x = 4
$$

So, 4 tickets were bought.

Each step in these examples follows the same logical process: isolate the variable and perform the same operation on both sides of the equation. This method ensures the balance and correctness of the equation, much like balancing both sides of a scale.
