   - B. Median  
   - C. Mode  
   - D. Range

16. **A set of exam scores is normally distributed with a mean of 70 and a standard deviation of 10. What percentage of students scored between 60 and 80?**

17. **If two events A and B are mutually exclusive, what is $P(A \cup B)$ if $P(A) = 0.3$ and $P(B) = 0.4$?**

18. **The probability of event A is 0.6, and event B is 0.7. Assuming A and B are independent, what is the probability of both A and B occurring?**
