1. **If a company's revenue model is represented by the equation $R = 200x - 1500$, where $R$ is the revenue in dollars and $x$ is the number of units sold, what is the revenue when 100 units are sold?**
   - A. $18,500
   - B. $19,500
   - C. $20,500
   - D. $21,500

2. **The profit $P$ (in dollars) for selling $x$ units of a product is given by $P = 50x - 400$. Determine the number of units that must be sold to achieve a profit of $2000$.**

3. **A linear model for predicting sales, $S$, based on advertising expenditure, $A$, is given by $S = 3A + 250$. Calculate the sales if the advertising expenditure is $400.**
   - A. 1250
   - B. 1450
   - C. 1550
   - D. 1750

4. **Consider the linear demand function $D = -5p + 350$, where $D$ is the quantity demanded and $p$ is the price of the product. What is the quantity demanded when the price is $60?**

5. **The cost $C$ for producing $x$ items is modeled by $C = 15x + 600$. What is the cost when 50 items are produced?**
   - A. $750
   - B. $1100
   - C. $1350
   - D. $1650

6. **A train travels at a speed modeled by $S = 60t + 30$, where $S$ is the speed in miles per hour and $t$ is the time in hours. Find the speed of the train after 5 hours.**

7. **In a certain city, the number of people attending a festival every year can be modeled by the quadratic equation $N = 5t^2 + 20t + 100$, where $N$ is the number of attendees and $t$ is the number of years after 2020. Predict the number of attendees in 2025.**

8. **A company's profit, in thousands of dollars, can be modeled by $P(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6$. Find the profit when $x = 3$.**

9. **The relationship between the temperature $T$ in degrees Celsius and time $t$ in hours can be modeled by $T = -4t + 30$. What is the temperature after 6 hours?**

10. **A quadratic model for a ball's height, $h$, after $t$ seconds is given by $h = -16t^2 + 64t + 5$. Calculate the height after 2 seconds.**

11. **The function $F(x) = 120 + 5x^2 - 2x^3$ models the number of units produced by a factory in month $x$. Determine the number of units produced in month 4.**

12. **A company's revenue can be modeled using the exponential function $R(t) = 500e^{0.05t}$, where $t$ is the time in years. Compute the revenue after 3 years.**

13. **The price of a product decreases exponentially according to the model $P(t) = P_0 e^{-0.1t}$ where $P_0$ is the initial price. If the initial price is $100, calculate the price after 2 years.**

14. **Determine the break-even point for the profit model $P = 30x - 450$. At what number of units does the company break even?**
   - A. 10
   - B. 15
   - C. 20
   - D. 25

15. **A distribution function is given as $D(x) = rac{5}{x + 2}$ for $x > 0$. Evaluate this function when $x = 3$.**
