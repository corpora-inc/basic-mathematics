The *College Algebra CLEP Practice Questions* corpus is strictly focused on providing **authentic test-style questions** that mirror the exact format, structure, and difficulty of the real CLEP exam. Each file should contain **only practice problems**, with minimal instructions and no explanatory text. The goal is to simulate real test conditions as closely as possible. Every question should be formatted as **multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, or free-response**, just as they appear on the CLEP exam. Avoid unnecessary commentaryâ€”students using this resource are here to practice, not to learn new material. Keep the wording precise, the answer choices realistic, and the problem difficulty aligned with official exam expectations.
