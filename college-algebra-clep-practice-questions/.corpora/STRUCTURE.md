# College Algebra CLEP Practice Questions Corpus Structure

## Filename Format

Each file in this corpus follows the format:

```
XXXX-descriptive-title.md
```

Where:
- `XXXX` is a four-digit sequential number starting from `0000`.
- `descriptive-title` is a concise and meaningful identifier for the type of questions in the file.
- Filenames are written in lowercase with hyphens (`-`) separating words.

## Organizational Rules

- The corpus consists exclusively of **practice questions** formatted exactly as they appear on the CLEP test.
- Each file contains a **single category or type of question**, with minimal explanatory text.
- The sequence should be structured logically, grouping similar topics together while ensuring a comprehensive range of College Algebra topics is covered.

## Content Guidelines

- Each file contains **only practice questions** formatted as multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, or free-response, as appropriate for CLEP.
- No lessons, explanations, or definitionsâ€”just structured and categorized practice material.
- Questions should be diverse in difficulty and directly aligned with CLEP test expectations.
- Whenever applicable, real test-style distractors and common mistakes should be incorporated into answer choices.

## Purpose

This structure ensures an efficient, exam-focused resource where students can systematically work through categorized practice questions, mimicking the actual CLEP College Algebra test environment as closely as possible.
