## Understanding Subtraction through the Unknown Addend Approach

Subtraction can be made easier by finding the missing number that makes an addition true.

When we see a subtraction problem like:

$$
 a - b = c
$$

This means:

- The first number, $a$, is the starting number.
- The second number, $b$, is the number you take away.
- The answer, $c$, is what is left.

We can also think of this as an addition problem:

$$
 b + c = a
$$

Here, $a$, $b$, and $c$ are symbols. They stand for numbers. In our words:

- The starting number minus the number you take away equals the answer.
- Or, the number you take away plus the answer makes the starting number.

### How to Solve Using the Unknown Addend Approach

1. Look at the first number. This is your starting number.
2. Look at the second number. This is the number you take away.
3. Ask: What number do I add to the second number to make the first number?

### Example 1: Solving 13 - 5 = ?

We start with the problem:

$$
 13 - 5 = ?
$$

This tells us:

- 13 is the starting number.
- 5 is the number you take away.

We ask: What do we add to 5 to get 13?

Rewrite it as:

$$
 5 + ? = 13
$$

The missing number is:

$$
 ? = 13 - 5 = 8
$$

So, 13 - 5 = 8.

Below is a number line that shows this process. The arrow starts at 5 and ends at 13, showing the addition of 8:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw[->] (0,0) -- (16,0) node[right] {Number Line};
    \foreach \x in {0,...,16}
        \draw (\x,0.1) -- (\x,-0.1) node[below] {\x};
    \draw[thick, red, ->] (5,0.5) -- (13,0.5);
    \node at (9,1) {+8};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

### Example 2: Solving 18 - ? = 14

Now, look at this problem:

$$
 18 - ? = 14
$$

Here:

- 18 is the starting number.
- 14 is the number left.

We ask: What number must be added to 14 to get 18?

Write it like this:

$$
 14 + ? = 18
$$

The missing number is:

$$
 ? = 18 - 14 = 4
$$

So, 18 - 4 = 14.

This number line shows the process. The arrow begins at 14 and ends at 18:

\vspace*{2em}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw[->] (10,0) -- (21,0) node[right] {Number Line};
    \foreach \x in {10,...,20}
        \draw (\x,0.1) -- (\x,-0.1) node[below] {\x};
    \draw[thick, blue, ->] (14,0.5) -- (18,0.5);
    \node at (16,1) {+4};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

### Recap

We learned that subtraction can be seen as finding the missing addend. In the equation:

$$
 a - b = c
$$

- $a$ is the starting number.
- $b$ is the number you take away.
- $c$ is the answer (what is left).

We can also write it as:

$$
 b + c = a
$$

This idea helps us think of subtraction as the reverse of addition.

Remember:

- Look at the starting number.
- See how much you take away.
- Find the missing number that makes the addition true.
