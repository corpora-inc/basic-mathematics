This unit introduces ways to display information using tables, graphs, and charts. You will learn how to arrange data in neat formats and understand what the data tells you.

**What**: This unit covers organizing numbers and facts into tables, drawing simple graphs, and reading charts. You will see different methods to sort and present information.

**Why**: Organizing data helps us see patterns and make decisions. Tables and graphs make complex information easy to understand.

**How**: 
- **Tables**: Arrange data in rows and columns for clear comparisons.
- **Graphs**: Use pictures and lines to show changes and differences.
- **Charts**: Visual tools that help us quickly compare numbers or categories.
