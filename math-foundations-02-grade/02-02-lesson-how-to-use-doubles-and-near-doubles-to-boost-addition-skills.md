## How to Use Doubles and Near-Doubles to Boost Addition Skills

Doubles are pairs of the same number added together. They are easy to remember. For example, 

$$ 4 + 4 = 8 $$

When you know the double, you can use it to add numbers that are close to it. These are called near-doubles.

### Using Doubles

A double is when the two numbers are the same:

- Example: $$ 3 + 3 = 6 $$

Knowing this fact can help you add quickly because you remember that doubling 3 gives 6.

### Using Near-Doubles

A near-double is when one number is one more or one less than its double. You can use the double and then adjust by 1.

- Example: To add $$ 3 + 4 $$, first think of the double of 3:

  $$ 3 + 3 = 6 $$

  Since 4 is one more than 3, add an extra 1:

  $$ 6 + 1 = 7 $$

Another example:

- Example: For $$ 5 + 4 $$, start with the double of 4:

  $$ 4 + 4 = 8 $$

  Since 5 is one more than 4, add 1 to 8:

  $$ 8 + 1 = 9 $$

### Step-by-Step Method

1. Identify if the problem is a double or near-double.
2. If it is a double, simply add the two same numbers. 
3. If it is a near-double, find the double, then adjust by adding or subtracting 1.

### Visual Example

Below is a simple diagram to help you see the process for near-doubles:

\vspace*{2em}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[->] (0,0) -- (4,0) node[right] {Number Line};
\draw[thick] (1,0) -- (3,0);
\node[below] at (1,0) {Double start};
\node[below] at (3,0) {Double result};
\draw[->, red, thick] (3,0) -- (3.8,0) node[right] {Add 1};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

This shows how you start with the double and then move one step to get the near-double result.

### Practice Together

Let's solve one together:

- Problem: $$ 6 + 7 $$

  Think of the double of 6:

  $$ 6 + 6 = 12 $$

  Since 7 is one more than 6, add 1:

  $$ 12 + 1 = 13 $$

Using doubles and near-doubles makes addition faster and easier. Remember to look for patterns and adjust when needed.
