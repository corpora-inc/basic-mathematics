## How to Use Doubles and Near-Doubles to Boost Addition Skills

Doubles are pairs of the same number added together. They are easy to remember. For example,

$$ 4 + 4 = 8 $$

When you know the double, you can use it to add numbers that are close to it. These are called near-doubles.

### Using Doubles

A double is when the two numbers are the same:

- Example: $$ 3 + 3 = 6 $$

Knowing this fact can help you add quickly because you remember that doubling 3 gives 6.

### Using Near-Doubles

A near-double is when one number is one more or one less than its double. You can use the double and then adjust by 1.

- Example: To add $$ 3 + 4 $$, first think of the double of 3:

  $$ 3 + 3 = 6 $$

  Since 4 is one more than 3, add an extra 1:

  $$ 6 + 1 = 7 $$

Another example:

- Example: For $$ 5 + 4 $$, start with the double of 4:

  $$ 4 + 4 = 8 $$

  Since 5 is one more than 4, add 1 to 8:

  $$ 8 + 1 = 9 $$

### Step-by-Step Method

1. Identify if the problem is a double or near-double.
2. If it is a double, simply add the two same numbers.
3. If it is a near-double, find the double, then adjust by adding or subtracting 1.

### Visual Example

Below is a revised diagram to help you see the process for near-doubles:

\vspace*{2em}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1,>=stealth]
    % Draw the number line from 0 to 10
    \draw[->] (0,0) -- (10,0) node[right] {Number Line};

    % Draw tick marks
    \foreach \x in {0,...,10} {
        \draw (\x,0.1) -- (\x,-0.1) node[below] {\x};
    }

    % Highlight points: double start at 3, double result at 6
    \draw[thick, blue] (3,0) circle (3pt) node[above] {(3)};
    \draw[thick, blue] (6,0) circle (3pt) node[above] {(6)};

    % Show near-double process: arrow from 6 to 7
    \draw[->, red, thick] (6,0) -- (7,0) node[midway,above] {+1};
    \draw[thick, red] (7,0) circle (3pt) node[above] {(7)};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\vspace*{2em}

This diagram shows how you start with the double (3 + 3 = 6) and then add 1 to move to the near-double result.

### Practice Together

Let's solve one together:

- Problem: $$ 6 + 7 $$

  Think of the double of 6:

  $$ 6 + 6 = 12 $$

  Since 7 is one more than 6, add 1:

  $$ 12 + 1 = 13 $$

Using doubles and near-doubles makes addition faster and easier. Remember to look for patterns and adjust when needed.
