## Mental Math Strategies to Improve Speed and Accuracy

Mental math means solving problems in your head quickly and correctly. In this lesson, you will learn different ways to think about numbers easily. We will use step-by-step examples to show you how to add and subtract faster.

### Strategy 1: Counting On for Addition

When you add two numbers, start from the larger number and count on. This is called counting on.

Example: Find $7 + 4$.

Step 1: Start at 7 on the number line.

Step 2: Count four numbers forward from 7.

7 (start), 8, 9, 10, and 11. So, $7+4=11$.

> Counting on means you add by moving step by step from the larger number.

### Strategy 2: Counting Back for Subtraction

When you subtract, you can count back. This helps you find the answer faster.

Example: Find $12 - 3$.

Step 1: Start at 12 on the number line.

Step 2: Count back three steps from 12.

12 (start), 11, 10, and 9. So, $12-3=9$.

> Counting back means you subtract by moving step by step to a smaller number.

### Strategy 3: Breaking Numbers Into Parts

Sometimes it helps to break numbers into smaller parts. You can add or subtract the parts and then join them together.

Example for Addition: Find $8+5$.

Step 1: Break 5 into 2 and 3.

Step 2: Add 2 to 8 first: $8+2=10$.

Step 3: Then add the remaining 3: $10+3=13$.

So, $8+5=13$.

Example for Subtraction: Find $15-7$.

Step 1: Break 7 into 5 and 2.

Step 2: Subtract 5 from 15 first: $15-5=10$.

Step 3: Then subtract 2 from 10: $10-2=8$.

So, $15-7=8$.

> Breaking numbers apart makes it easier to see the smaller steps of a problem.

### Strategy 4: Compensation Strategy

Sometimes it's easier to adjust the numbers to round figures and then compensate. For example, to compute $9 + 7$:
- Think of 9 as 10, so $10 + 7 = 17$.
- Since you added one too many, subtract 1: $17 - 1 = 16$.

This “round and adjust” method can speed up your calculations!

### Strategy 5: Friendly Numbers and Doubling

If you recognize doubles, you can use them to your advantage. For example:
- You know that $6 + 6 = 12$.
- So, if you need to compute $6 + 7$, it’s just one more than 12, which is $12 + 1 = 13$.

This works well for numbers that are close to doubles.

### Strategy 6: Inverse Operations for Checking

After solving a problem, use the opposite operation to check your answer. For instance:
- If you calculate $15 - 7 = 8$, check by adding: $8 + 7$ should equal 15.
- This helps ensure you didn't make a mistake.

These strategies, along with counting on, counting back, and breaking numbers apart, give you multiple tools to solve addition and subtraction problems quickly and accurately!

### Using a Number Line to Visualize Problems

A number line is a great tool to see the steps in your head. Look at the number line and move along it.

For example, let’s use a number line for $9+3$.

\vspace*{2em}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[->] (0,0) -- (15,0) node[right] {Number Line};
\foreach \x in {0,...,15}
    \draw (\x,0.1) -- (\x,-0.1) node[below] {\x};
\draw[thick, red, ->] (9,0) -- (12,0);
\node at (10.5,-0.5) {$+3$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Start at 9 and move three steps to the right to reach 12. So, $9+3=12$.

### Tips for Improving Speed and Accuracy

- Practice each strategy until you feel comfortable.
- Use a number line to see your steps clearly.
- Try different strategies to see which one works best for you.
- Always check your answer by thinking through each step again.

Each strategy helps you see the problem in a simple way. With these methods, you can solve addition and subtraction problems faster and more accurately!
