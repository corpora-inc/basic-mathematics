## How to Perform Subtraction with Regrouping and Borrowing

When subtracting two-digit numbers, sometimes the top number’s ones digit is smaller than the bottom number’s ones digit. In this case, we borrow 1 ten from the tens place to help with the subtraction.

### Example: 47 − 38

Step 1: Write the numbers in columns.

$$
\begin{array}{r@{\hspace{1mm}}r}
  4 & 7 \\
-\,3 & 8 \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

Step 2: Look at the ones place. Since 7 is less than 8, there is not enough to subtract. We borrow 1 ten from the tens place.

• The tens digit 4 decreases by 1 to become 3.
• The ones digit 7 gains 10, becoming 17.

Now the problem looks like this:

$$
\begin{array}{r@{\hspace{1mm}}r}
  3 & 17 \\
-\,3 & 8 \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

Step 3: Subtract the ones place.

$$17 - 8 = 9$$

Step 4: Subtract the tens place.

$$3 - 3 = 0$$

The final answer is 9.

### Visualizing the Borrowing

Borrowing means taking 1 ten from the tens place and adding it to the ones place, making it easier to subtract numbers that originally seem too small.

> Borrowing helps break numbers into groups of tens and ones so the subtraction can be done step by step.

### Number Line Example

The following number line shows how we subtract 8 from 17 in the ones place:

\vspace*{2em}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[->] (0,0) -- (12,0) node[right] {Number Line};
\foreach \x in {0,...,12}
    \draw (\x,0.1) -- (\x,-0.1) node[below] {\x};
\draw[thick, red, ->] (8,0) -- (17,0);
\node at (12.5, -0.5) {Subtract 8 from 17};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\vspace*{2em}

Using this method, you can borrow and subtract numbers step by step. Practice with different problems to become more confident with subtraction with regrouping and borrowing.
