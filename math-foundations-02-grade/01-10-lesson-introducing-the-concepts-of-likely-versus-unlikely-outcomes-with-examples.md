## Introducing the Concepts of Likely Versus Unlikely Outcomes with Examples

This lesson explains what it means for an outcome to be likely or unlikely. We will learn which events happen often and which happen only a little.

### What Does 'Likely' Mean?

An outcome is likely if it happens most of the time. It means it happens often.

Example: Imagine a spinner with 5 equal parts. If 4 parts are red and 1 part is blue, the spinner usually lands on red.

### What Does 'Unlikely' Mean?

An outcome is unlikely if it happens only a little. It means it does not happen very often.

Example: In a bag with 10 marbles, if 8 are green and 2 are purple, drawing a purple marble happens less often than drawing a green one.

### Step-by-Step Example with Marbles

1. You have a bag with 10 marbles.

2. Count the marbles: 8 are green and 2 are purple.

3. When you pick one marble, you will most likely get a green marble because there are more green marbles.

4. A purple marble is less likely because there are only 2 purple marbles.

### Step-by-Step Example with a Spinner

1. Imagine a spinner divided into 5 equal parts.

2. 4 parts are colored red and 1 part is blue.

3. When you spin the spinner, it will often point to red because most parts are red.

4. It is less common for the spinner to stop on blue since only one part is blue.

> Outcomes that happen often are likely. Outcomes that happen just a little are unlikely.
