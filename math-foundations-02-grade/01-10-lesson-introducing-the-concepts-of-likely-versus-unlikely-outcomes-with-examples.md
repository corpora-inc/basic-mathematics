## Introducing the Concepts of Likely Versus Unlikely Outcomes with Examples

This lesson explains the ideas of likely and unlikely outcomes. It helps us understand which events happen most of the time and which do not.

### What Does 'Likely' Mean?

An outcome is considered likely if it has a high chance of happening. This means it will happen most of the time when you try the event.

Example: Imagine a spinner divided into 5 equal parts. If 4 parts are red and 1 part is blue, landing on red is likely because it has a greater chance.

### What Does 'Unlikely' Mean?

An outcome is unlikely if it has a low chance of happening. This means it will happen only a few times when you try the event.

Example: In a bag with 10 marbles where 8 are green and 2 are purple, drawing a purple marble is unlikely because there are fewer purple marbles.

### Step-by-Step Example with Marbles

1. Consider a bag with 10 marbles.

2. Count the marbles: 8 are green and 2 are purple.

3. When you draw one marble, it is more likely to be green because many green marbles are in the bag.

4. Drawing a purple marble is unlikely because there are only 2 purple marbles.

$$
\text{Probability of drawing a green marble} = \frac{8}{10} = 0.8
$$

$$
\text{Probability of drawing a purple marble} = \frac{2}{10} = 0.2
$$

### Step-by-Step Example with a Spinner

1. Imagine a spinner divided into 5 equal sections.

2. 4 sections are colored red and 1 section is blue.

3. When you spin the spinner, it is likely to land on red because 4 out of 5 sections are red.

4. Landing on blue is unlikely because there is only 1 blue section.

$$
\text{Probability of red} = \frac{4}{5} = 0.8
$$

$$
\text{Probability of blue} = \frac{1}{5} = 0.2
$$

> Outcomes that occur often are likely. Outcomes that occur rarely are unlikely.
