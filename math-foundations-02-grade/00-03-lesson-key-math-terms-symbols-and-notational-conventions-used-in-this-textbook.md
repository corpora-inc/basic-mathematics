## Key Math Terms, Symbols, and Notational Conventions Used in This Textbook

In this lesson, you will learn about the math words, symbols, and ways of writing that you will see in this book. Knowing these helps you follow and solve problems step by step.

### Key Math Terms

- **Number**: A symbol or word that shows how many things there are. For example, 1, 2, and 3.

- **Addition**: Putting numbers together to find a total.

- **Subtraction**: Taking one number away from another to find the difference.

- **Multiplication**: Adding equal groups quickly. This means you add the same number several times.

- **Division**: Splitting a number into equal parts or groups.

- **Equals**: A word or symbol that means both sides are the same.

### Important Math Symbols

- **Plus Sign (+)**: Used for addition.

  Example:
  $$
  3 + 2 = 5
  $$

- **Minus Sign (−)**: Used for subtraction.

  Example:
  $$
  5 - 2 = 3
  $$

- **Multiplication Sign $\times$**: Used for multiplication.

  Example:
  $$
  4 \times 3 = 12
  $$

- **Division Sign (÷ or /)**: Used for division.

  Example:
  $$
  12 ÷ 4 = 3
  $$
  or
  $$
  12 / 4 = 3
  $$

- **Equals Sign (=)**: Shows that the numbers on each side have the same value.

  Example:
  $$
  3 + 2 = 5
  $$

### Notational Conventions

- **Writing Numbers**: We use digits like 1, 2, 3, etc., to show amounts.

- **Using Symbols for Operations**: Write $+$ for addition, $-$ for subtraction, $\times$ or * for multiplication, and $÷$ or / for division.

- **Order of Operations** (Simple for Grade 2):
  - When numbers are added or subtracted, work from left to right.
  - In many problems, multiplication or division is done by grouping numbers together before adding or subtracting.

### More Things You Will See

- **Equal Parts**: When you split a number into groups that are the same, each group has equal parts.

- **Grouping**: Putting numbers together to add them or multiply them easily.

- **Word Problems**: You will see stories or questions that use these words and symbols to ask questions about everyday situations.

> Learning these math words, symbols, and ways of writing will help you understand every math lesson in this book.
