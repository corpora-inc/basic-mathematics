## Key Math Terms, Symbols, and Notational Conventions Used in This Textbook

### Introduction
In this lesson, you will learn about the key math terms, symbols, and notational conventions that you will encounter in this textbook. Understanding these will help you follow lessons and solve problems more easily.

### Key Math Terms
- **Number**: A symbol or word used to represent a quantity.
- **Addition**: The process of finding the total or sum by combining two or more numbers.
- **Subtraction**: The process of finding the difference by taking one number away from another.
- **Multiplication**: The process of finding the total when combining equal groups.
- **Division**: The process of splitting into equal parts or groups.

### Important Math Symbols
- **Plus Sign (+)**: Used in addition to show numbers being added. 
  
  Example: $3 + 2 = 5$
  
- **Minus Sign (−)**: Used in subtraction to show numbers being subtracted.
  
  Example: $5 - 2 = 3$
  
- **Multiplication Sign (× or \*)**: Used in multiplication to show numbers being multiplied.
  
  Example: $4 \times 3 = 12$ or $4 * 3 = 12$
  
- **Division Sign (÷ or /)**: Used in division to show numbers being divided.
  
  Example: $12 ÷ 4 = 3$ or $12 / 4 = 3$

- **Equals Sign (=)**: Shows that two amounts are the same. 
  
  Example: $7 = 7$

### Notational Conventions
- **Writing Numbers**: Use digits to write numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
- **Operations**: Use symbols to show math operations (e.g., $+$, $−$, $×$, $÷$).
- **Order of Operations**: The order in which math operations are performed can change the result:
  1. Parentheses
  2. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
  3. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

### Example Problem
Let's look at a simple problem using these terms and symbols:

**Problem**: What is $2 + 3 × 4 - 5$?

**Solution**:
1. According to the order of operations, do the multiplication first: $3 × 4 = 12$.
2. Replace and do the next operation from left to right: $2 + 12 = 14$.
3. Finally, subtract: $14 - 5 = 9$.

**Answer**: $2 + 3 × 4 - 5 = 9$

Now you have seen how to use key math terms, symbols, and notations. Understanding these basics is essential to learning and solving math problems effectively.
