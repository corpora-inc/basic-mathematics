## Solving Real-World Word Problems Using Addition and Subtraction Techniques

Word problems use stories to help us practice math. In these problems, you read about a situation, decide what math to use, and then solve it step by step.

### Step 1: Read the Problem Carefully

Read the problem slowly. Look for key words that tell you if you need to add or subtract.

> Key words for addition: together, in all, more, total.
>
> Key words for subtraction: left, remain, fewer, lost.

### Step 2: Identify the Important Numbers

Write down the numbers from the story. Decide what each number means in the problem.

For example:

Lucy has 5 apples. She buys 3 more apples. What is the total number of apples?

The numbers are 5 and 3.

### Step 3: Decide Which Operation to Use

Use addition when the problem tells you to combine numbers. Use subtraction when you remove some from a group.

In Lucy's problem, she is adding her apples, so you add the numbers.

### Step 4: Solve Using Addition

Write the addition problem:

$$
\begin{array}{r}
  5 \\
+ 3 \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

Now, add them:

$$
\begin{array}{r@{}r}
   & 5 \\
+  & 3 \\
\hline
  & 8 \\
\end{array}
$$

Lucy now has 8 apples.

### Example 2: Using Subtraction

Michael had 10 marbles. He lost 4 marbles. How many marbles does he have left?

Here, you need to subtract because some items are taken away.

Write the subtraction problem:

$$
\begin{array}{r@{\hspace{2mm}}r}
  10 \\
-\, 4 \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

Subtract step by step:

$$
\begin{array}{r@{\hspace{2mm}}r}
  10 \\
-\, 4 \\
\hline
   6 \\
\end{array}
$$

Michael has 6 marbles left.

### Visualizing the Problem with a Number Line

Using a number line can help you see how numbers change when you add or subtract.

For Lucy's problem (5 + 3):

\vspace*{2em}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[x=0.8cm]
  \draw[->] (4,0) -- (13,0) node[right] {Number Line};
  \foreach \x in {5,6,7,8} {
    \draw (\x,0.2) -- (\x,-0.2) node[below] {\x};
  }
  \draw[thick, red, ->] (5,0.4) -- (8,0.4);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

For Michael's problem (10 - 4):

\vspace*{2em}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[x=0.8cm]
  \draw[->] (5,0) -- (12,0) node[right] {Number Line};
  \foreach \x in {6,7,8,9,10} {
    \draw (\x,0.2) -- (\x,-0.2) node[below] {\x};
  }
  \draw[thick, red, <-] (10,0.4) -- (6,0.4);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

### Step 5: Check Your Work

Look over your numbers and steps. Answer the question in your own words:

- Lucy's problem: 5 apples plus 3 apples equal 8 apples.
- Michael's problem: 10 marbles minus 4 marbles equal 6 marbles.

By breaking the problem into small parts, you can use addition and subtraction to solve real-world problems.
