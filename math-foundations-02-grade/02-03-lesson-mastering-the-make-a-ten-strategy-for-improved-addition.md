## Mastering the Make-a-Ten Strategy for Improved Addition

The make-a-ten strategy helps us add numbers by first making a sum of 10. This makes the problem easier.

### What Is the Make-a-Ten Strategy?

This strategy means we look for a pair of numbers that add up to 10. Once we make a 10, we add the rest of the number.

For example, with $8 + 6$, we see that $8$ needs $2$ to make $10$. We can break $6$ into $2 + 4$. Then, we add

$$
8 + 6 = (8 + 2) + 4 = 10 + 4 = 14
$$

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Identify the Number to Complete 10:**
   Look at the first number. Ask, “How many more do I need to reach 10?”

2. **Break the Second Number:**
   Split the second number into two parts. One part fills the gap to 10; the other is extra.

3. **Add in Two Steps:**
   First, add to make 10. Then add the extra part.

### Detailed Example

Let’s add $7 + 5$ using the make-a-ten strategy.

1. Start with $7$. It needs $3$ to reach $10$.

2. Break $5$ into $3$ and $2$.

3. Add $7 + 3$ to get $10$.

4. Then, add the remaining $2$.

$$
7 + 5 = (7 + 3) + 2 = 10 + 2 = 12
$$

### Another Example

Now, try adding $9 + 4$.

1. Start with $9$. It needs $1$ to reach $10$.

2. Break $4$ into $1$ and $3$.

3. Add $9 + 1$ to get $10$.

4. Then, add the remaining $3$.

$$
9 + 4 = (9 + 1) + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13
$$

### Visual Representation

Below is a number line that shows how the make-a-ten strategy works. First, move from the first number to 10, then add the remaining amount.

### Practice in Your Mind

When you see an addition problem, try to see if one number can be paired with part of the other to form 10. This technique makes adding faster and easier.
