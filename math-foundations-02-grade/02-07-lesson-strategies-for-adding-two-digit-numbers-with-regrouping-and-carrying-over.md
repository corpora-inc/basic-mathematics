## Strategies for Adding Two-Digit Numbers With Regrouping and Carrying Over

### Introduction

When we add two-digit numbers, sometimes the ones digits add to a number that is 10 or more. This is called regrouping or carrying over. Regrouping helps us add numbers correctly.

### Step-by-Step Process

We will add two numbers: $$47 + 38$$.

1. Write the numbers one under the other, aligning the tens and ones.

   $$
   \begin{array}{r}
   47 \\
   +38 
   \end{array}
   $$

2. Add the ones digits: $$7 + 8 = 15$$.
   - Write down $$5$$ in the ones place.
   - Carry over $$1$$ to the tens column.

3. Add the tens digits: $$4 + 3 = 7$$, then add the carried $$1$$ to get

   $$7 + 1 = 8$$.

4. Write down $$8$$ in the tens place.

The final answer is $$85$$.

### Visualizing the Ones Addition

To see how the ones addition works, look at the number line below. We start at $$7$$ and move $$8$$ steps. This helps us understand how we reach $$15$$.

\vspace*{2em}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  % Draw the number line from 7 to 15
  \draw[->] (0,0) -- (8,0) node[right] {Number Line};
  \foreach \x in {0,...,8}
    \draw (\x,0.1) -- (\x,-0.1) node[below] {$7+\x$};
  \draw[thick, red, ->] (0,0) -- (8,0);
  \node at (4,0.5) {$+8$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

In this diagram, starting at $$7$$ and moving $$8$$ steps lands at $$15$$. This shows the sum of the ones digits before regrouping.

### Alternative Example

Letâ€™s add another pair: $$56 + 27$$.

1. Add the ones digits: $$6 + 7 = 13$$. Write down $$3$$ and carry over $$1$$.

2. Add the tens digits: $$5 + 2 = 7$$, then add the carried $$1$$:

   $$7 + 1 = 8$$.

The final answer is $$83$$.

### Key Point

> If the ones digits add up to a number 10 or more, write down the last digit and carry the extra value to the tens column.

Use these steps to add many two-digit numbers with regrouping accurately.
