## Strategies for Adding Two-Digit Numbers with Regrouping and Carrying Over

In this lesson, we learn how to add two-digit numbers when the sum of the ones column is more than 9. This is called regrouping or carrying over. We will use a step-by-step method with clear examples.

### Adding Two Numbers with Regrouping

We start by writing the numbers one under the other so that the ones and tens are in the correct columns.

For example, consider adding $47$ and $38$:

$$
\begin{array}{r@{}r}
  47 \\
+ 38 \\
\hline
  85 \\
\end{array}
$$

Step 1: Add the ones column. Here, $7+8=15$. Write $5$ in the ones place and carry $1$ to the tens column.

Step 2: Add the tens column. Now add $4+3$ and the carried $1$: $4+3+1=8$. Write $8$ in the tens place. The answer is $85$.

Using a detailed array, we can show the carried number above the tens column:

$$
\begin{array}{r@{}r@{}r}
   1 &   & \\
   4 & 7 & \\
+  3 & 8 & \\
\hline
   8 & 5 & \
\end{array}
$$

### Another Example

Let us add $36$ and $47$ using the same method.

Step 1: Write the numbers:

$$
\begin{array}{r@{}r}
  36 \\
+ 47 \\
\hline
  83 \\
\end{array}
$$

Step 2: Add the ones column: $6+7=13$. Write $3$ in the ones place and carry $1$ to the tens column.

Step 3: Add the tens column: $3+4=7$, then add the carried $1$ for a total of $8$. Write $8$ in the tens place.

A complete written method with the carried number looks like this:

$$
\begin{array}{r@{}r@{}r}
   1 &   & \\
   3 & 6 & \\
+  4 & 7 & \\
\hline
   8 & 3 & \\
\end{array}
$$

### Summary of the Steps

1. Write the two-digit numbers aligned by their ones and tens places.
2. Add the ones column. If the sum is $10$ or more, write the ones digit and carry the tens digit to the next column.
3. Add the tens column along with any carried number to get the final answer.

Practice these steps carefully to become confident in adding two-digit numbers with regrouping.
