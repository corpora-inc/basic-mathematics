## Certain Events and Impossible Events

This lesson explains two types of events: certain events and impossible events. We will learn the difference between events that always happen and events that can never happen.

### Understanding Certain Events

A certain event is one that always happens. This means there is no chance for it not to happen.

For example:

- When you wake up in the morning, the sun will rise. This is a certain event because the sun always rises.
- If you have 2 apples and you do not eat any, you will still have 2 apples. This is certain.

> Certain events are like rules that always work.

### Understanding Impossible Events

An impossible event is one that can never happen. There is no chance for it to happen.

For example:

- Rolling a regular 6-sided die and getting a 7 is impossible because the die has only the numbers 1 to 6.
- A fish cannot fly in the sky. This is impossible under normal conditions.

> Impossible events are things that do not follow the rules of our world.

### Step-by-Step Comparison

1. Identify the event you are thinking of.
2. Decide if the event always happens. If yes, it is a certain event.
3. Decide if the event can never happen. If yes, it is an impossible event.
4. Use a simple example to check your idea.

For instance, consider the event: "A square has four sides." This event is certain because every square always has four sides.

Now consider: "A square has five sides." This event is impossible because it does not follow the rules of geometry.

These ideas help us understand how to look at events in everyday life and in math. By knowing if an event is certain or impossible, we can make better decisions and check our work in problems.
