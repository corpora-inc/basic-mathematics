## Developing Skills to Find 10 More and 10 Less Than a Given Number

In this lesson, we will learn how to find 10 more than a number and 10 less than that number. We use the ideas of adding 10 to make a number bigger and subtracting 10 to make a number smaller.

### What Does "10 More" Mean?

"10 more" means adding 10 to the number. For example, if you start with the number 25, then:

$$
25 + 10 = 35
$$

This tells us that 10 more than 25 is 35.

### What Does "10 Less" Mean?

"10 less" means subtracting 10 from a number. For example, if you start with 40, then:

$$
40 - 10 = 30
$$

This means 10 less than 40 is 30.

### Step-by-Step: Finding 10 More Than a Given Number

1. Look at the given number.
2. Add 10 to the given number.
3. The result is the number that is 10 more.

**Example:** Find 10 more than 18.

$$
18 + 10 = 28
$$

### Step-by-Step: Finding 10 Less Than a Given Number

1. Look at the given number.
2. Subtract 10 from the given number.
3. The result is a number that is 10 less.

**Example:** Find 10 less than 32.

$$
32 - 10 = 22
$$

### Visualizing on a Number Line

A number line can help you see the jump of 10 units. Look at the number line below for finding 10 more than 14 and 10 less than 14.


\vspace*{2em}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[x=0.5cm]
  % Draw a number line from 5 to 25
  \draw[->] (5,0) -- (25,0) node[right] {Number Line};
  \foreach \x in {5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25}
      \draw (\x,0.1) -- (\x,-0.1) node[below] {\x};
  
  % Arrow for 10 more than 14
  \draw[<-, thick, red] (14,1) -- (24,1);
  \node at (19,1.5) {+10};
  
  % Arrow for 10 less than 14
  \draw[<-, thick, blue] (14,-1) -- (4,-1);
  \node at (9, -1.5) {-10};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\vspace*{2em}

In the diagram:

- The red arrow shows that if you start at 14 and add 10, you reach 24.
- The blue arrow shows that if you start at 14 and subtract 10, you go to 4.

### Practice Explanation in Real Life

Imagine you have 14 toy cars. If someone gives you 10 more, you will have:

$$
14 + 10 = 24 
$$

toy cars. If you give away 10 toy cars, then:

$$
14 - 10 = 4 
$$

you are left with 4 toy cars.

### Summary

- To find 10 more than a number, add 10.
- To find 10 less than a number, subtract 10.

These ideas help you solve problems quickly and understand changes in amounts in different everyday situations.
