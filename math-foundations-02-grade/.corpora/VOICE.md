Use a clear, direct, and structured tone suitable for an 8-year-old student. Explanations should be methodical, step-by-step, and precise.

- Be concise. Explain concepts in the simplest way without extra wording.
- Present one step at a time. Avoid introducing multiple ideas at once.
- Keep the tone neutral and instructional. No exaggerated enthusiasm, rhetorical questions, or unnecessary encouragement.
- Speak to the student as a learner, not as a peer. Assume engagement through clarity and effectiveness.
- Use minimal wording for maximum clarity. No long-winded explanations.
- Provide structured examples that show a clear problem-solving process before any independent practice.
- Do not include history, trivia, or unrelated facts. Stay strictly on the math concept.

This is a lesson book, not a workbookâ€”focus on guided examples, not practice problems.
