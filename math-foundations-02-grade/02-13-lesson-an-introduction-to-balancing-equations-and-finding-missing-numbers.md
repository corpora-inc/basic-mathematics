## An Introduction to Balancing Equations and Finding Missing Numbers

An equation is like a scale. Both sides must be equal. In an equation, we add numbers and sometimes a missing number makes one side lighter. We find the missing number to balance the equation.

### What Is a Balanced Equation?

A balanced equation looks like this:

$$
3 + \; ? \; = 7
$$

This means when you add the number that is missing (the question mark) to 3, you get 7. To find the missing number, we subtract 3 from 7.

$$
? = 7 - 3
$$

So, the missing number is 4. We can check it:

$$
3 + 4 = 7
$$

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Look at the equation. One side is missing a number.
2. Find the known number on that side (here, it is 3).
3. Subtract the known number from the total on the other side (7 - 3).
4. The result is the missing number (4).

### Visualizing the Equation

Imagine a balance scale. One side has the numbers you know, and the other side shows the total value. The missing number is what you need to add to the first side so the scale stays balanced.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  % Draw the base of the scale
  \draw[thick] (0,0) -- (4,0);
  \draw[thick] (2,0) -- (2,3);

  % Left pan with known number 3
  \draw (0.5,0) -- (0.5,-0.5) node[below] {3};
  
  % Right pan with total 7
  \draw (3.5,0) -- (3.5,-0.5) node[below] {7};

  % Indicating the missing number on the top
  \node at (2,2.5) {?};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

### Another Example

Consider this equation:

$$
? + 5 = 10
$$

To find the missing number, follow these steps:

1. Identify the known number on the left side (5).
2. Subtract 5 from 10.

$$
? = 10 - 5
$$

So, the missing number is 5. We can check:

$$
5 + 5 = 10
$$

### Practice in Your Head

Think about the equation:

$$
2 + ? = 5
$$

Ask yourself: What number added to 2 gives 5? You can solve it by subtracting 2 from 5:

$$
? = 5 - 2
$$

So, the missing number is 3. Check it by adding:

$$
2 + 3 = 5
$$

### Key Ideas

> A balanced equation means both sides have the same value. 

We use subtraction to find the missing number when one side of the equation is incomplete.

This concept helps us understand that every action in math has an opposite action. In these problems, subtraction is the opposite action of addition.

By practicing these steps, you learn to think about numbers as part of a balanced game, where both sides must be equal.
