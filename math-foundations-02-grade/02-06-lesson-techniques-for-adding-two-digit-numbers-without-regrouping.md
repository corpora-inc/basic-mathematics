## Techniques for Adding Two-Digit Numbers Without Regrouping

When we add two-digit numbers without regrouping, the ones (the right digits) add to less than 10. This makes the addition simple.

### Understanding Two-Digit Addition

Two-digit numbers have a tens digit and a ones digit. For example, in the number $23$, the digit $2$ is in the tens place and $3$ is in the ones place.

> In these problems, we only add numbers where the ones digits add to less than 10. This means we do not need to carry a number to the tens place.

### Step-by-Step Process

1. Write the numbers in a column so that the tens and ones digits are aligned.

2. Add the ones digits. Since there is no regrouping, the sum is less than 10.

3. Add the tens digits. Multiply the tens digit by 10 to find its value.

4. Combine the tens sum and the ones sum to get the final answer.

We can express the steps as follows:

$$
\text{For } 23 + 15:\
\quad \text{Ones: } 3 + 5 = 8 \\
\quad \text{Tens: } 20 + 10 = 30 \\
\quad \text{Total: } 30 + 8 = 38
$$

### Visualizing with a Number Line

A number line helps us see the addition process. Start at the first number and count forward by the ones digit.

For example, to add the ones digits in $23 + 15$:

\vspace*{2em}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[->] (22,0) -- (30,0) node[right] {Number Line};
\foreach \x in {23,...,28}
    \draw (\x,0.1) -- (\x,-0.1) node[below] {\x};
\draw[thick, red, ->] (23,0.2) -- (28,0.2);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

This shows that adding $5$ to $23$ gives $28$. Then, when we add the tens (which is $20 + 10$), we combine them with the ones sum to get $38$.

### Worked Example

Let's work through another example: $42 + 31$.

1. Break down each number into tens and ones:

   - $42$ is $40$ (tens) and $2$ (ones).
   - $31$ is $30$ (tens) and $1$ (ones).

2. Add the ones digits:

$$
2 + 1 = 3
$$

3. Add the tens digits:

$$
40 + 30 = 70
$$

4. Combine the sums:

$$
70 + 3 = 73
$$

These steps show how we add two-digit numbers when no regrouping is needed.

### Practice in Your Mind

Remember, when the ones digits add up to less than $10$, you can add each column separately. This method keeps the addition simple and clear.
