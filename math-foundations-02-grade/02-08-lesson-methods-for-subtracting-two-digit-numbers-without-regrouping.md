## Methods for Subtracting Two-Digit Numbers Without Regrouping

Subtracting two-digit numbers without regrouping means that in each column the top digit is greater than or equal to the bottom digit. We work with the tens and ones places separately.

### Understanding Place Value

Each two-digit number has a tens place and a ones place. In subtraction without regrouping, the digit in the tens and ones places of the top number is at least as big as the corresponding digit in the bottom number.

### Example 1: Subtracting 65 - 32

Step 1: Write the numbers in column form.

$$
\begin{array}{r}
 65 \\
-32 \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

Step 2: Subtract the ones place.

$$5 - 2 = 3$$

Step 3: Subtract the tens place.

$$6 - 3 = 3$$

The answer is $33$.

### Example 2: Subtracting 84 - 42

Step 1: Write the numbers in column form.

$$
\begin{array}{r}
 84 \\
-42 \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

Step 2: Subtract the ones place.

$$4 - 2 = 2$$

Step 3: Subtract the tens place.

$$8 - 4 = 4$$

The answer is $42$.

### Visual Method Using a Number Line

A number line can help you see subtraction in action. For instance, with $65 - 32$, you can start at $65$ and count backward by $32$. Break the subtraction into parts:

- Count back $30$ from $65$ to land on $35$.
- Then count back $2$ more to reach $33$.

\draw[->] (30,0) -- (70,0) node[right] {Number Line};
\foreach \x in {30,35,40,45,50,55,60,65,70}
    \draw (\x,0.1) -- (\x,-0.1) node[below] {\x};
\draw[thick, red, ->] (65,0) -- (33,0);
\node at (49,0.8) {$-32$};
\end{tikzpicture}
