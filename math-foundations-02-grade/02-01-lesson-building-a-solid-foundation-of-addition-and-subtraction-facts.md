## Building a Solid Foundation of Addition and Subtraction Facts

In this lesson, we will learn how addition and subtraction facts work. We will see how to combine numbers and take them apart step by step.

### Understanding Addition

Addition means combining two groups of items to find out how many there are in total. For example, if you have 2 apples and then get 3 more apples, you have:

$$
2 + 3 = 5
$$

> Addition helps us see the total when we combine things.

Here is a step-by-step guide for addition:

1. Start with the first number.
2. Count up by the second number.
3. The number you reach is the total.

For example:

- Start with 2.
- Count up 3 steps: 3, 4, 5.
- You reach 5, so $2 + 3 = 5$.

### Understanding Subtraction

Subtraction means taking away a part from a whole to find out what remains. If you have 5 apples and give away 3, you have:

$$
5 - 3 = 2
$$

> Subtraction helps us know how many are left when something is removed.

Follow these steps for subtraction:

1. Start with the total number.
2. Count back by the number you take away.
3. The number you land on is what remains.

For example:

- Start with 5.
- Count back 3 steps: 4, 3, 2.
- You reach 2, so $5 - 3 = 2$.

### Using a Number Line

A number line is a visual tool to help understand addition and subtraction. Draw a line with numbers in order. When adding, move to the right. When subtracting, move to the left.

Below is an example number line for $2 + 3 = 5$:

\vspace*{2em}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[->] (0,0) -- (6,0) node[right] {Number Line};
\foreach \x in {0,...,6}
    \draw (\x,0.1) -- (\x,-0.1) node[below] {\x};
\draw[thick, blue, ->] (2,0) -- (5,0);
\node at (3.5,0.5) {$+3$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

The arrow shows that we move from 2 to 5 by adding 3.

Now, see a number line for $5 - 3 = 2$:

\vspace*{2em}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[->] (0,0) -- (6,0) node[right] {Number Line};
\foreach \x in {0,...,6}
    \draw (\x,0.1) -- (\x,-0.1) node[below] {\x};
\draw[thick, red, ->] (5,0) -- (2,0);
\node at (3.5,-0.5) {$-3$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

### Relating Addition and Subtraction

Addition and subtraction are like two sides of the same coin. If $a + b = c$, then $c - b = a$. For example, since $2 + 3 = 5$, it also means that $5 - 3 = 2$.

> Remember: Finding the missing number is easier when you know how addition and subtraction work together.

### Step-by-Step Example

Let us solve an example together:

$$
4 + 2 = ?
$$

Step 1: Start with 4.

Step 2: Count up 2 steps: 5, 6.

Step 3: The answer is 6, so

$$
4 + 2 = 6
$$

Now, if we reverse the operation:

$$
6 - 2 = ?
$$

Step 1: Start with 6.

Step 2: Count back 2 steps: 5, 4.

Step 3: The answer is 4, so

$$
6 - 2 = 4
$$

This shows how addition and subtraction are connected.

### Practicing with Real-Life Examples

Imagine you have 4 pencils. You find 2 more pencils on the desk. When you count all your pencils, you have 6:

$$
4 + 2 = 6
$$

If you then give 2 pencils to a friend, you are left with:

$$
6 - 2 = 4
$$

Understanding these steps will help you build a solid foundation for both addition and subtraction facts.
